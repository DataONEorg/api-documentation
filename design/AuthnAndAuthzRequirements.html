<p>It is necessary to provide a mechanism for users to be identified in the DataONE system. There are several distinct roles that need to be supported for users.Rationale: Identity of users, contributors and other participants in DataONE is necessary to ensure appropriate policies for data sharing (read, write), attribution, and notification (e.g. subscription to types of data).</p>
<p>Fit Criteria</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Users can identify themselves in the DataONE system</p></li>
<li><p>Identity is consistent across all nodes (i.e. identity associated with an object is consistent regardless of where the object is retrieved from or acted on)</p></li>
<li><p>Users can associate various accounts with a single identity</p></li>
<li><p>Identity information is sufficient to ensure appropriate attribution to content</p></li>
<li><p>Authentication and authorization mechanisms are recognized consistently by all participant nodes and services of the cicore.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing user directories in use in environmental science community can directly contribute identities (not “yet another” identity system)</p></li>

<p>There are several types of users that will be interacting with the DataONE infrastructure, as such it is necessary to ensure that user roles can be supported by the identity management infrastructure. Closely related to <a class="reference external" href="https://trac.dataone.org/ticket/390">https://trac.dataone.org/ticket/390</a></p>
<p>Rationale: Different user classes or groups provides an effective mechanismfor indicating the types of interaction that might be supported by the system. The alternative is to specifically assign privileges for each user - an
approach that is inefficient and potentially insecure as it is easy to miss an
individual when setting privileges for a large number of users.</p>

<li><p>Additional groups can be created to support group functions as necessary</p></li>
<li><p>Users can create their own groups for ad-hoc collaboration when needed and without approval of system administrators</p></li>

<p>Access control for objects is evaluated for every object access in the DataONE infrastructure.  As such, the mechanisms used to determine if a particular token (i.e. handle to an authenticated principle) must be very efficient and should not offer a barrier to the desired levels of access control in the system.</p>
<p>Rationale</p>
<p>Access control should not be an impediment to effective use of the content available through DataONE.</p>
<p>Fit Criteria</p>

<p>Users might be able to upload data and science metadata as an atomic operation, but each should be identified separately and access control rules should apply to the objects separately.  For example, a user could grant public read access to a metadata object but only grant read access to certain colleagues for associated data objects.</p>

Enabling access control at the same level of granularity of objects in the system ensures that complete control over object conglomerations (packages, etc) is available.</p>

<p>Many existing directory services are in use in the environmental sciences, and participating member nodes should be able to expose their directories through a standardized mechanism to allow users to make use of existing identities.  For example, the KNB LDAP server is a federation of multiple LDAP systems from around the world, and these identities have been used in access rules for many existing objects.Rationale: Re-use of existing infrastructure reduces cost of participation and minimizes confusion over which accounts to use and which rules are associated with what account.</p>

<p>When principals die, retire, change careers, or lose interest in a research area, they may leave in the system data objects that would be otherwise useful to science but are restricted access.  The authorization system should have carefully crafted default policies that encourage the public release and sharing of data, the expiration of embargo periods, and the movement of data into the public domain when it is legal and ethical to do so.  Principals should be able to override these defaults to create more restrictive policies (e.g., for human subjects data) that will be respected indefinitely, but the defaults should encourage openness and sharing.</p>
<p>Fit Criteria</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Defaults encourage openness and sharing, without alienating principals through unexpected release of their data, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While the principals contributing data should be able to specify access, they frequently struggle with the software systems intended to do so, and at times make mistakes.  The system should support certain roles with elevated privielges for groups of objects to allow, e.g, a system administrator or data curator to change objects for which they are not otherwise granted access.  For example, all objects that are associated with a particular field station might be managed by the information manager at that field station, and the person filling that role through time might change.  Individual principals should be able to determine who has access to objects, both through explicit grants of access and through indirect roles that may be only implicitly defined.</p>

<p>When user identities can be drawn from multiple providers, we need to be able to serialize both the id and the provider namespace, for example by encapsulating both in a single distinguished name (DN).  Ideally this serialization would be relatively short, persistent, and human understandable, and ideally it should not contain spaces or other characters that make it difficult to utilize in a variety of contexts (such as command line applications).</p>
<p>An example DN that has worked for the KNB network is:</p>

<p>Many applications will need to be adapted to work with the authentication and authorization services provided.  Ideally, the services chosen will be compatible with existing systems and support those systems through standard protocols.  Applications will need to commonly connect to, for example, web applications using HTTP Basic Authentication for Apache and JAAS for servlets like Tomcat.  In addition, some applications may want to connect via PAM and similar security mechanisms.  Some identity services, such as LDAP, are commonly supported in these scenarios.</p>

<p>Several types of access directives are in common use in data packages in the environmental sciences, and the authorization system should support these.  The most common authorization levels would include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>read: the ability to display or download an object</p></li>
<li><p>write: the ability to change the content of an object through an update operation (which does not mean it actually changes the object – it may just create a new version that obsoletes the old)</p></li>
<li><p>changePermission: the ability to change access control rules on the object</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Often, the permission levels are nested, in that higher privilege levels encompass the lower levels as well (e.g., write access to an object implies read access).</p>
<p>See the EML access control module for a detailed explanation of these levels (eml-access module).</p>
<p>In addition to specifying levels of permissions on the individual data objects, the authorization system should allow node administrators to specify what services principals can utilize on their nodes, and any resource constraints that may apply.  For example, a Member Node operator may want to specify for their node several rules, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>user joe can insert or update objects on node 32</p></li>
<li><p>user jack can not update objects on node 21</p></li>
<li><p>user joe has an aggregate storage limit of 1TB (may want to consider soft and hard resource limits)</p></li>
<li><p>user joe has a network bandwidth transfer limit of 10mb/s</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note that these types of node-level resource limitations may not be implemented currently on most member nodes, but the authorization system should be expressive enough to allow node operators to build in these restrictions.</p>

<p>The system should be able to revoke any user’s permissions and, ultimately, their direct access to the system, if the user is misbehaving within the system.</p>
<p>Although it is unclear as to who assigns permissions, I believe that the final responsibility and authority for access control is the DataONE administrator.  As such, permissions and simple access to any part of the DataONE infrastructure, and perhaps member node infrastructure that is accessed through DataONE, should be revokable.</p>
<p>Fit Criteria</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Administrator can change permissions for a user for any object</p></li>
<li><p>Permission changes are propagated through the system within XXX seconds</p></li>
