DataONE APIs
============

This document describes the outward facing application programming interfaces
(APIs) available for the three major components of the DataONE infrastructure:
Coordinating and Member Nodes and the Investigator Toolkit.

   *Figure 1.* Overview of the system components and the methods being called
   by each component. An arrow to a target indicates the origin is calling the
   method on the target.

Services are implemented using a RESTful model using HTTP as the transport
protocol and XML for encoding messages.

Member Nodes can expose different levels of functionality while participating
in the DataONE network. Four tiers of MN functionality have been identified,
The tiers and Member Node APIs necessary to support are summarized in the
table below. Also indicated are the corresponding Coordinating Node APIs
that are necessary for functionality expressed for each tier.

   * - Tier
     - Description
     - MN APIs
     - CN APIs
   * - 1
     - Public read, no authentication or access control of content. No content
       can be created through the DataONE service interfaces. The node can not
       act as a replication target.
     - :mod:`MNCore`, :mod:`MNRead`
     - :mod:`CNCore`, :mod:`CNRead`
   * - 2
     - Read and resolve with access control support.
     - Tier 1 + :mod:`MNAuthorization`
     - :mod:`CNAuthorization`, :mod:`CNRegister`, :mod:`CNIdentity`
   * - 3
     - Write (create, update, delete), possibly limited support for data types
     - Tier 2 + :mod:`MNStorage`
     - 
   * - 4
     - Replication target. The types of content supported by the node may be
       limited to a subset of object formats.
     - Tier 3 + :mod:`MNReplication`
     - :mod:`CNReplication`

The specific methods that must be implemented for each tier are listed in the
respective APIs.
