REST Interface Overview
-----------------------

This document describes how the Member (:doc:`MN_APIs`) and Coordinating
(:doc:`CN_APIs`) Node APIs are implemented using a Representational State
Transfer (REST) approach over HTTP.

Key points on REST interactions in DataONE:

- Content is modeled as collections, with :class:`PIDs <Types.Identifier>`
  identifying individual items of a collection.

- The HTTP verbs HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE are used for retrieving
  information about content, retrieving content, creating content, updating
  content, and deleting content respectively.

- State information, if required, is passed in the HTTP headers.

- Identity transfer is performed using SSL, with the client certificate
  accessible through implementation specific mechanisms supported by the
  respective server environment.

- Hints to support efficient caching (e.g. content time stamps) should be
  respected. Caching is an important mechanism for achieving scalability.

- Several URL patterns described in these documents support parameters as key,
  value pairs. Unless otherwise indicted, the key and value are case sensitive
  and SHOULD be preserved or the request MAY be rejected with an
  :exc:`Exceptions.InvalidRequest` exception.

- Message bodies are encoded using MIME Multipart, mixed (RFC2046_).

- Messages containing complex DataONE types (i.e. types that have more than a
  single value) are encoded in their XML representation.

- Simple types are transmitted as parameter parts in the MIME Multipart mixed
  body.

- Complex types and octet streams are transmitted as file parts in the MIME
  Multipart mixed body.


Collections exposed by :term:`Member Node`\s and :term:`Coordinating Node`\s
include:

:``/object``:
  The set of objects available for retrieval from the node.

:``/meta``:
  Metadata about objects available for retrieval from the node.
  
:``/formats``:
  Object formats registered on the node.

:``/log``:
  Log records held on the node.

:``/reserve``:
  Identifiers that have been reserved for future use.

:``/accounts``:
  Principal and ownership related functionality.

:``/sessions``:
  Authenticated session management functions.

:``/node``:
  Service and status information for all nodes on the system.

:``/monitor``: 
  Node health monitoring

:``/replicate``:
  Member node to member node replication functionality



Message Serialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The format of the response (except for responses from :func:`MNRead.get` or
:func:`CNRead.get`) is determined by the *Accept:* header provided in the
request. 

Version 1.0 of the DataONE services only support XML serialization, and this
format MUST be supported by all services and clients interacting with the
DataONE system.

All request and response documents MUST be encoded using the UTF-8 character
set.

If the service is not able to provide a response in the specified format, then
the node should return an error code of :exc:`Exceptions.NotImplemented`, with
the HTTP error code set to 406.



Parameters in Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many of the URL patterns described here accept parameters in the URL and as
components of a MIME multipart-mixed message body.

Unless otherwise indicated, all parameter names and values should be considered
case sensitive. 

Session Information
...................

Session information (formerly referred to as a *token*) is obtained from the
client side authentication certificate held by the SSL processing library of the
HTTPS service handling the request. Hence, even though a *session* parameter may
be present in the method signature, the session information itself is
transported as part of the HTTPS handshaking process and is not present in the
body or header section of the HTTP request.


URL Path Parameters
...................

Some parameters are passed as part of the REST service URL path (e.g.
/get/{pid}). Such values MUST be encoded according to the rules of RFC3986_ with
the additional restriction that the space character MUST be encoded as "%20"
rather than "+". Examples of DataONE REST URLs for retrieving an object (i.e.
the get() operation)::

  PID: 10.1000/182
  URL: https://mn.example.com/mn/v1/object/10.1000%2F182

  PID: http://example.com/data/mydata?row=24
  URL: https://mn.example.com/mn/v1/object/http:%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fdata%2Fmydata%3Frow=24

  PID: Is_f√©idir_liom_ithe_gloine
  URL: https://mn.example.com/mn/v1/object/Is_f%C3%A9idir_liom_ithe_gloine


URL Query Parameters
....................

Parameters passed as key, values parameters in the URL query string MUST be
appropriately encoded for transmission as part of the URL according to RFC3986_
rules for the URL query component. In addition, the space character MUST be
encoded as "%20" rather than the alternative "+" character.


Boolean URL Query Parameters
............................

Where a boolean parameter value is being specified as the value portion of a
key-value pair appearing in a URL, the strings "true" and "false" MUST be used
to indicate logical true and logical false respectively.


Date Parameters in URLs
.......................

Date values in URLs should be formatted as::
  
  yyyy-MM-dd[Thh:mm:ss.S[+ZZ:zz]]
  
Where::
    
  yyyy = Four digit year
  MM   = Two digit month, 01 = January
  dd   = Two digit day of month, 01 = first day
  hh   = Hour of day, 00 - 23
  mm   = Minute of hour, 00 - 59
  ss   = Second of minute, 00 - 59
  S    = Milliseconds
  ZZ   = Hours of timezone offset
  zz   = Minutes of timezone offset

If the timezone values are not present then the date time is interpreted to be
in GMT.

If the time portion of the date time is not present, then the time is assumed to
be 00:00:00.0, i.e. the first millisecond of the specified date.


Message Body in PUT or POST
...........................

Requests sent using the HTTP POST or PUT verbs MUST use MIME multipart-mixed
encoding of the message body as described in RFC2046_. In most cases and unless
otherwise indicated, all parameters for PUT and POST requests except the
authorization session will be sent in the message body (as opposed to URL
parameters). 

Example of a HTTP POST request to the MN create() method using *curl*::

  curl -X POST \
       --cert /tmp/x509up_u502 \
       -H "Charset: utf-8" \
       -H "Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=----------6B3C785C-6290-11DF-A355-A6ECDED72085_$" \
       -H "Accept: text/xml" \
       -H "User-Agent: pyd1/1.0 +http://dataone.org/" \
       -F pid=10Dappend1.txt \
       -F object=@content.bin \
       -F sysmeta=@systemmetadata.abc \
       "https://demo1.test.dataone.org/knb/d1/mn/v1/object"

Example serialized body of a HTTP POST request to the MN create() method
(excluding session information)::


  TODO


Message Body in DELETE
......................

RFC2046_ does not explicitly prevent the presence of a message body in a HTTP
DELETE request, however support for transmission of the request payload may vary
by technology. DELETE requests requiring a request payload MUST have
accompanying integration tests that exercise the technologies involved.
