State of Health API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Health API contains methods for determining the status of the DataONE
infrastructure, including both the CNs and MNs.

.. module:: CN_health
   :synopsis: Methods for reporting on the state of health of a CN and on the entire DataONE infrastructure

:: 

  generateReport(token) -> statusReport


.. function:: actOnPendingEvent (event)

.. function:: reportPendingEvent (event)

.. function:: Admin Application

.. function:: notify (adminID, nodeID, service)


.. function:: generateReport(token) -> statusReport

   Returns a status report for all of the registered Member Nodes. The
   informatio returned is used to give administrators information necessary to
   maintain the infrastructure.

   .. note:: 
      This method is used by Use Case 10 "MN Status Reports" for V0.3. However
      instead of a complete set of detailed status reports, the V0.3
      implementation of the use case will utilize the ``MN_health.heartbeat()``
      method to compile very basic information about the MNs. Later versions of
      this method will use the richer ``MN_health.getStatus(token)`` method.

   :param token: Identity with authority to generate reports.
   
   :rtype: Status report, ideally in XML + stylsheet or at least XHTML.
