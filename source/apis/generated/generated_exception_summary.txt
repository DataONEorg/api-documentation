     - Used to indicate that an object is not present on the node where the exception was raised.  The error message should include a reference to the :func:`CN_crud.resolve` method URL for the object.
   * - :exc:`Exceptions.NotImplemented`
     - `501 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.2>`_

     - Some sort of system failure occurred that is preventing the requested operation from completing successfully. This error can be raised by any method in the DataONE API.
   * - :exc:`Exceptions.UnsupportedMetadataType`
     - `400 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.1>`_
