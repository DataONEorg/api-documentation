.. function:: registerAccount(cert,person) -> Subject

   Create a new :term:`subject` in the DataONE system. Note that there should probably be a lot more metadata captured about the new user, and there should be a mechanism for specifying the default access control rules for the new account.

   :Use Cases:
     :doc:`UC16 </design/UseCases/16_uc>`
   :REST URL: ``POST /accounts``
   :param cert: X.509 Certificate, passed to the system via SSL client-side authentication, and used to identify and validate the identity of the Subject making the call. The X.509 certificate should be traceable to the CILogon service, and provides various attributes for authorization decisions.  If the X.509 certificate is not provided, then the request should be considered to have originated from the DataONE 'Public' user.
   :type cert: :class:`Types.X509Certificate`

   :param person: Information about the Person to be registered with the account, including the real name and email address for the individual.  The Subject with the Person must match the subject of the X.509 certificate associated with the authenticated SSL session via client-side authentication, and must not have been registered previously.
   :type person: :class:`Types.Person`

   :returns: The new subject in the DataONE system.  This may be a simple identifier.
   :rtype: :class:`Types.Subject`

   :raises Exceptions.ServiceFailure: ``(errorCode=500, detailCode=4530)``

   :raises Exceptions.IdentifierNotUnique: ``(errorCode=409, detailCode=4500)``

     The chosen identity already exists in the system

   :raises Exceptions.InvalidCredentials: ``(errorCode=401, detailCode=4520)``

     Raised if the supplied credentials are invalid, such as an invalid X.509 certificate.

   :raises Exceptions.NotImplemented: ``(errorCode=501, detailCode=4501)``

   :raises Exceptions.InvalidRequest: ``(errorCode=400, detailCode=4502)``




.. function:: updateAccount(cert,person) -> Subject

   Update an existing :term:`subject` in the DataONE system. The target subject is determined from the X509Certificate. Note that there should probably be a policy for verifying the details that change via this method.

   :Use Cases:
     :doc:`UC16 </design/UseCases/16_uc>`
   :REST URL: ``PUT /accounts``
   :param cert: X.509 Certificate, passed to the system via SSL client-side authentication, and used to identify and validate the identity of the Subject making the call. The X.509 certificate should be traceable to the CILogon service, and provides various attributes for authorization decisions.  If the X.509 certificate is not provided, then the request should be considered to have originated from the DataONE 'Public' user which will likely not be able to update the details.
   :type cert: :class:`Types.X509Certificate`

   :param person: New information about the Person. The subject of the Person cannot be updated with this method and must match the subject of the X.509 certificate associated with the authenticated SSL session via client-side authentication.
   :type person: :class:`Types.Person`

   :returns: The Subject in the DataONE system that was updated.
   :rtype: :class:`Types.Subject`

   :raises Exceptions.ServiceFailure: ``(errorCode=500, detailCode=4530)``

   :raises Exceptions.InvalidCredentials: ``(errorCode=401, detailCode=4520)``

     Raised if the supplied credentials are invalid, such as an invalid X.509 certificate.

   :raises Exceptions.NotImplemented: ``(errorCode=501, detailCode=4501)``

   :raises Exceptions.InvalidRequest: ``(errorCode=400, detailCode=4502)``




.. function:: verifyAccount(cert,subject) -> Boolean

   Verify that the Person data associated with this Subject is a true representation of the real world person.

   This service can only be called byt users who have an administrative role for the domain of users in question.

   :REST URL: ``POST /accounts/{subject}``
   :param cert: X.509 Certificate, passed to the system via SSL client-side authentication, and used to identify and validate the identity of the Subject making the call. The X.509 certificate should be traceable to the CILogon service, and provides various attributes for authorization decisions.  If the X.509 certificate is not provided, then the request should be considered to have originated from the DataONE 'Public' user.
   :type cert: :class:`Types.X509Certificate`

   :param subject: The Subject identifier of the Person to be verified.  After this service is called for a subject by an authorized user, the account is marked as verified by this user.
   :type subject: :class:`Types.Subject`

   :returns: True if the account verification succeeds, otherwise false.
   :rtype: :class:`Types.Boolean`

   :raises Exceptions.ServiceFailure: ``(errorCode=500, detailCode=4550)``

.. function:: mapIdentity(cert,subject) -> Boolean

   Map the two authenticated identities, asserting that they represent the same subject.

   Mapping identities is a two-step process wherein a map request is made by a primary Subject and a subsequent (confirmation) map request is made by the secondary Subject. This ensures that mappings are performed only by those that have authority to do so.

   :REST URL: ``POST /accounts/map``

   Groups are lists of subjects that allow all members of the group to be referenced by listing solely the subject name of the group.  Group names must be unique within the DataONE system, and can only be modified by their creator.

   :REST URL: ``POST /groups/{groupName}``
   :param cert: X.509 Certificate, passed to the system via SSL client-side authentication, and used to identify and validate the identity of the Subject making the call. The X.509 certificate should be traceable to the CILogon service, and provides various attributes for authorization decisions.

     A group by this name already exists




.. function:: addGroupMembers(cert,groupName,members) -> Boolean

   Add members to the named group.

   Group members can be added by the original creator of the group, otherwise a NotAuthorized exception is thrown.  Group members are provided as a list of subjects to be added to the group.

   :REST URL: ``PUT /groups/{groupName}``
   :param cert: X.509 Certificate, passed to the system via SSL client-side authentication, and used to identify and validate the identity of the Subject making the call.
