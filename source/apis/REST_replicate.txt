Replication Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/replicate`` collection represents replication functionality for MN -> MN
replication.  It is exposed by Member Nodes.

.. _MN_replicate.replicate:

``GET/replicate/<source_node_reference>/<pid>``
...............................................


The CN calls this function on its member nodes when a replica copy is required
to be sent from one MN to another.  The call is effectively a pull operation,
telling the called MN to get the document from the source_node_reference node
and insert it into its own local document store.  The source_node_reference
must be looked up using the node registry.  This cannot be assumed to be a URI
to another member node.  

Implemented by the methods:

- :func:`MN_replicate.replicate`

**Parameters**

This call takes no parameters.

**Response**

The response should be a valid HTTP response with a blank or arbitrary body.
Only the HTTP header information is considered by the requestor. A successful
response must have a HTTP status code of 200. In case of an error condition,
the appropriate HTTP status code must be set, and an exception or error
information *may* be returned in the response.
