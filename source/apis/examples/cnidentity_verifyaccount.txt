**Example**

Verify the subject ``http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6513-4996``. Note that the
subject appears as a URL path element, and so must be escaped appropriately in
the request.

Note also that the call must be made by a subject with administrative
privileges. In this case, the client certificate of a Coordinating Node
are used.

The response status code of "200" indicates the call was successful. An exception
would be returned with a corresponding status code if the call failed.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo curl -s \
      --cert private/urn_node_CNUCSB1.pem \
      -X PUT \
      -w "Status: %{http_code}\n" \
      "https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/accounts/verification/http%3A%2F%2Forcid.org%2F0000-0002-6513-4996"
    Status: 200

Example of a failure (subject incorrect):

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo curl -s \
      --cert private/urn_node_CNUCSB1.pem \
      -X PUT \
      -w "Status: %{http_code}\n" \
      "https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/accounts/verification/http%3A%2F%2Forcid.org%2F0000-0002-6513"
