**Examples**

The outgoing request body *must* be encoded as `MIME multipart/form-data`_ with the system metadata portion and the object as file attachments. 

(POST) Create a new object with a given identifier (*XYZ33256*)::

  curl -H "AuthToken: UR45W21A1S19ZE3CC9" \
       -F "file=@datafile.csv;name=object" \
       -F "file=@sysmeta.xml;name=systemmetdata" \
       http://m1.dataone.org/mn/object/XYZ33256
  
  HTTP/1.1 200 Success

**GMN Specific Implementation Note**

By default, object storage is managed by GMN. By specifying the option
vendor_gmn_remote_storage when creating an object, the caller can specify that
the object is stored at another location. In that case, the submitted object
is interpreted as a URL through which the object bytes can be retrieved.
