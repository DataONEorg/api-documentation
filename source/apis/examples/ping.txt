**Response**

The response should be a valid HTTP response with a blank or arbitrary body.
Only the HTTP header information is considered by the requestor. A successful
response MUST have a HTTP status code of 200. In case of an error condition,
the appropriate HTTP status code MUST be set, and an exception or error
information MAY be returned in the response.

**Example**

Example of ping request and response for a Member Node. Lines prefixed with
“>” indicate outgoing information, lines prefixed with “<” show content
returned from the server. Note that the actual response headers may vary, the
only required header is the first status line. However, in order to fully
support clients that may cache the response, it is recommended that the
*Date*, *Expires*, and *Cache-Control* headers are returned.
