**Response**

The response should be a valid HTTP response with a blank or arbitrary body.
Only the HTTP header information is considered by the requestor. A successful
response must have a HTTP status code of 200. In case of an error condition,
the appropriate HTTP status code must be set, and an exception or error
information *may* be returned in the response.
