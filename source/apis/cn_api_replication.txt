Replication API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Replication API manages :term:`replication` of system metadata and science
metadata among Coordinating Nodes to ensure that complete copies of those
objects are maintained on all Coordinating Nodes.


.. Note:: Since this will be handled out-of-band with respect to the CN APIs
  for V0.3, there are no Replication API methods required for V0.3.

.. module:: CN_replication
   :synopsis: Manages replication of content between Coordinating Nodes.

.. TODO:: flesh these out.
