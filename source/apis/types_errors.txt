  .. attribute:: errorCode

    The error code. This is the HTTP error code (i.e. 4xx)

  .. attribute:: detailCode

    A more detailed error code which provides a precise indication of where the
    exception was raised. This is a string formatting using a dot notation,
    where the first word is an integer value that is uniquely associated with a
    DataONE API call and additional words may be appended to provide application
    specific detail about the error. For example, :func:`MN_crud.get` returns a
    detail code of 1020 with a :exc:`Exceptions.NotFound` error. A specific
    Member Node implementation may append additional error codes, for example:
    "1020.1.14" might indicate that the NotFound error was caused by an IO error
    that indicated the requested file did not exist, as opposed to some other IO
    error raised by the system. Detail code words beyond the first word are
    application specific.

  .. attribute:: description

    A human readable message describing what happened

  .. attribute:: traceInformation

    A dictionary of key-value pairs that can provide more information about
    the error condition.
