Core API
~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MNCore
   :synopsis: Base operations for Member Nodes

The *MN_core* API provides mechanisms for a Member Node to report on the level
of service compliance and to specify replication policies. The capabilities
information is used in the Member Node registration process by the
Coordinating Nodes.

The state of health API provides mechanisms for the monitoring infrastructure 
to report on the current state of the DataONE infrastructure and for the
Coordinating Nodes to track the current operating state of the Member Node.

Read API
~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MNRead
   :synopsis: Provide tier 1 operations for sharing content from a Member Node.

The *MN_read* API implements methods that enable object management
operations on a :term:`Member Node`.

Authorization API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MNAuthorization
   :synopsis: Authorization and access control operations for Member Nodes

Provides mechanisms Member Nodes to verify access to resources for users
(:term:`subject`). See the document :doc:`/design/Authentication` for more
details on some authentication options.

Storage API
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MNStorage
   :synopsis: Methods for manipulating (changing) content on a Member Node

.. include:: generated/generated_MNStorage.txt



Replication API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Replication API provides methods to support CN-directed replication of
content between MNs.


.. module:: MNReplication
   :synopsis: Handles CN directed replication of content between Member Nodes.
