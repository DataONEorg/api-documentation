Member Node APIs
----------------

Authentication API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_authentication
   :synopsis: Authentication operations for Member Nodes

Provides a mechanism for a User (:term:`principal`) to authenticate themselves
with the DataONE system. See the document :doc:`/design/Authentication` for more
details on some authentication options.

Authorization API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_authorization
   :synopsis: Authorization operations for Member Nodes

Provides a mechanism for a User (:term:`principal`) to verify that an operation
is permitted for an authenticated User. See the document :doc:`/design/Authentication`
for more details on some authentication and authorization options.

CRUD API
~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_crud
   :synopsis: Create, read, update, and delete operations on Member Nodes

The ``MN_crud`` API implements methods that enable object management
operations on a :term:`Member Node`.

Capabilities API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_capabilities
   :synopsis: Reports the capabilities of a Member Node


.. include:: generated/generated_MN_capabilities.txt



----

State of Health API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_health
   :synopsis: Reports on the status of a Member Node

.. include:: generated/generated_MN_health.txt


----


Replication API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Replication API handles CN-directed replication of content between MNs and
also supports the initial harvesting of science metadata from a MN by a CN.
Method names used for the former (MN-to-MN replication) include some form of
"replication" in their name. Method names used for the latter (MN-to-CN
synchronization) include some form of "synchronize" in their name. Support for
MN-to-MN replication is not part of the V0.3 APIs.

   :synopsis: Handles CN directed replication of content between Member Nodes.
