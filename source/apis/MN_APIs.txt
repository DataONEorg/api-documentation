Member Node APIs
----------------

.. include:: generated/generated_MN_function_table.txt


Core API
~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_core
   :synopsis: Base operations for Member Nodes

The *MN_core* API provides mechanisms for a Member Node to report on the level
of service compliance and to specify replication policies. The capabilities
information is used in the Member Node registration process by the
Coordinating Nodes.

The state of health API provides mechanisms for the monitoring infrastructure 
to report on the current state of the DataONE infrastructure and for the
Coordinating Nodes to track the current operating state of the Member Node.

Read API
~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_read
   :synopsis: Provide tier 1 operations for sharing content from a Member Node.

The *MN_read* API implements methods that enable object management
operations on a :term:`Member Node`.

Authentication API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_auth
   :synopsis: Authentication and authorization operations for Member Nodes

Provides a mechanism for a User (:term:`principal`) to authenticate themselves
with the DataONE system. See the document :doc:`/design/Authentication` for
more details on some authentication options. Also provides a mechanism for a
User (:term:`principal`) to verify that an operation is permitted for an
authenticated User. See the document :doc:`/design/Authentication` for more
details on some authentication and authorization options.

Storage API
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_storage


.. include:: generated/generated_MN_storage.txt



Replication API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Replication API handles CN-directed replication of content between MNs and
also supports the initial harvesting of science metadata from a MN by a CN.
Method names used for the former (MN-to-MN replication) include some form of
"replication" in their name. Method names used for the latter (MN-to-CN
synchronization) include some form of "synchronize" in their name. 


.. module:: MN_replication
   :synopsis: Handles CN directed replication of content between Member Nodes.
