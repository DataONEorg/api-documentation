Member Node APIs
----------------

Authentication API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_authentication
   :synopsis: Authentication operations for Member Nodes

Provides a mechanism for a User (:term:`principal`) to authenticate themselves
with the DataONE system. See the document :doc:`/design/Authentication` for
more details on some authentication options.

----


Authorization API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_authorization
   :synopsis: Authorization operations for Member Nodes

Provides a mechanism for a User (:term:`principal`) to verify that an
operation is permitted for an authenticated User. See the document
:doc:`/design/Authentication` for more details on some authentication and
authorization options.

----


CRUD API
~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_crud
   :synopsis: Create, read, update, and delete operations on Member Nodes

The *MN_crud* API implements methods that enable object management
operations on a :term:`Member Node`.  


.. include:: generated/generated_MN_crud.txt

----


Capabilities API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_capabilities
   :synopsis: Reports the capabilities of a Member Node

The *MN_capabilities* API provides mechanisms for a Member Node to report on
the level of service compliance and to specify replication policies. The
capabilities information is used in the Member Node registration process by
the Coordinating Nodes.

----

State of Health API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_health
   :synopsis: Reports on the status of a Member Node

The state of health API provides mechanisms for the monitoring infrastructure 
to report on the current state of the DataONE infrastructure and for the
Coordinating Nodes to track the current operating state of the Member Node.

.. include:: generated/generated_MN_health.txt


----


Replication API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Replication API handles CN-directed replication of content between MNs and
also supports the initial harvesting of science metadata from a MN by a CN.
Method names used for the former (MN-to-MN replication) include some form of
"replication" in their name. Method names used for the latter (MN-to-CN
synchronization) include some form of "synchronize" in their name. 


.. module:: MN_replication
   :synopsis: Handles CN directed replication of content between Member Nodes.
