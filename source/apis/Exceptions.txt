Exceptions Raised by MN and CN APIs

General
~~~~~~~

All exceptions raised by API methods in DataONE must include three basic
elements of information and an optional element ``traceInformation`` as
detailed in :class:`Types.ErrorMessage`, repeated here for convenience.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 2 2 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Element
     - Cardinality
     - Description
   * - errorCode
     - 1
     - The error code. This is the HTTP error code (i.e. 4xx). In all cases,
       the HTTP Status Code value in the response headers *should* match this
       value.
   * - detailcode
     - 1
     - A code that can be mapped to a specific location in the source code of
       the implementation. Implemented as a string with dot notation to
       indicate progressive levels of detail.
   * - pid
     - 0..1
     - Required for exceptions that include an identifier in the constructor 
       signature (e.g. NotFound, IdentifierNotUnique, SynchronizationFailed).
   * - description
     - 0..1
     - A human readable message describing what happened
   * - traceInformation
     - 0..1
     - Optional free text providing more information about the error
       condition. The intent of this element is to assist with debugging. Note
       that care should be taken to ensure senstive information is not 
       accidentally exposed through error conditions.

HTTP Exception Handling Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTTP error codes of relevance to the DataONE cicore are repeated here for
convenience. Refer to the `HTTP specification`_ for a complete reference.

==== =================== =======================================================
Code Meaning             Description
==== =================== =======================================================
400  Bad Request         Bad request if the request REST operation is invalid,
                         serialization is erroneous, mime type is not supported, 
                         or resource is not supported.  
401  Unauthorized        Authentication failure. Credentials are required or 
                         were invalid. 
403  Forbidden           The current user does not have the right to perform 
                         the requested action.
404  Not Found           The object does not exist.
405  Method not allowed  The HTTP method used is not allowed on this resource.
                         Response must include an Allow header indicating valid
                         HTTP methods.
406  Not Acceptable      The resource identified by the request is only capable 
                         of generating response entities which have content 
                         characteristics not acceptable according to the accept 
                         headers sent in the request.
408  Request Timeout     The client did not produce a request within the time 
                         that the server was prepared to wait.
409  Conflict            The request could not be completed due to a conflict 
                         with the current state of the resource.
410  Gone                The resource is known to be permanently deleted (as 
                         opposed to 404 which indicates uncertainty about the
                         state of the object).   
413  Request Entity Too  The server is refusing to process a request because 
     Large               the request entity is larger than the server is willing 
                         or able to process.
415  Unsupported Media   The server is refusing to service the request because 
     Type                the entity of the request is in a format not supported 
                         by the requested resource for the requested method. 
500  Internal Server     The server encountered an unexpected condition which 
     Error               prevented it from fulfilling the request. 
501  Not Implemented     The server does not support the functionality required 
                         to fulfill the request. This is the appropriate
                         response  when the server does not recognize the
                         request method and is not capable of supporting it for
                         any resource.

Serializing Exception Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exceptions can be serialized in different formats that vary according to where
the error occurs and what caller the error message is being sent to. Four
common serialization formats will be HTML, XML, JSON, and Log. The general
approach for serializing error messages is indicated by way of example below.
For errors raised in response to a HTTP call (e.g. through the REST interface),
the error should be serialized in the format indicated in the request Accept
header, defaulting to HTML.

Examples of a :exc:`Exceptions.NotFound` error raised by a request to
:func:`MN_crud.get` object ``123XYZ`` from a Member Node. The trace
information contains ``{'method':'mn.get'}``.

In HTML:

.. code-block:: html

  <html>
    <head>
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" />
      <title>Error: 404 Not Found (1020.1)</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Error</dt>
          <dd class='erroName'>NotFound</dd>
          <dt>Code</dt>
          <dd class='errorCode'>404</dd>
          <dt>Detail Code</dt>
          <dd class='detailCode'>1020.1</dd>
          <dt>Identifier</dt>
          <dd class='pid'>123XYZ</dd>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <p class='description'>The specified object does not exist on this node.</p>
      <pre class='traceInformation'>
        method: mn.get
        hint: Please try resolving http://cn.dataone.org/cn/resolve/123XYZ
      </pre>
    </body>
  </html>


In XML:

.. code-block:: xml

  <error name='NotFound'
         errorCode='404' 
         detailCode='1020.1' 
         pid='123XYZ'>
    <description>The specified object does not exist on this node.</description>
    <traceInformation>
      method: mn.get
      hint: http://cn.dataone.org/cn/resolve/123XYZ
    </traceInformation>
  </error>


In JSON::

  {
    'name': 'NotFound',
    'errorCode':404,
    'detailCode': '1020.1',
    'pid': '123XYZ',
    'description': 'The specified object does not exist on this node.',
    'traceInformation': 'method: mn.get
      hint: http://cn.dataone.org/cn/resolve/123XYZ'
  }


Log message body. This type of representation is presented here as a
suggestion. The actual log representation may differ according to the actual
implementation::

  [detail:1020.1][identifier:123XYZ, method:mn.get]The specified object does not exist on this node.
