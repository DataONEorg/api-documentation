Data Types from SAML used in CICore
-----------------------------------

.. module:: SAML
   :synopsis: Catalog of data types (structures) from the SAML V2.0 standard that are used by the DataONE cicore. 

Catalog of data types (structures) from the `SAML V2.0`_ standard that
are used by the DataONE cicore. The Assertion class from SAML2 is used, with
most of the SAML Attributes being represented in terms of their names as
found in the `SAML V2.0 X.500/LDAP Attribute Profile`_.

.. _SAML V2.0: http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications#samlv20

.. _SAML V2.0 X.500/LDAP Attribute Profile: http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/28042/sstc-saml-attribute-x500-cs-01.pdf

.. Note:: Here we use the Sphinx ``class`` directives to identify data
  structures. This is not meant to imply that these structures are implemented
  as classes - it is merely a convenience mechanism for documentation.

.. class:: Assertion

  An Assertion represents the set of metadata attributes about an
  authenticated session in DataONE.  An Assertion is identified by its
  identifier, which can be used to retrieve the Assertion data structure that
  serializes metadata attributes describing the session itself, the Principal
  that was authenticated, and verification data such as digital signatures that
  can be used to verify the validity of the session data.  Assertion data in
  DataONE are serialized as a SAML 2 Assertion, and contain particular 
  elements from the SAML specifications. Not all SAML2 compliant elements can
  be used in DataONE.  Instead, the following elements from SAML are used as
  metadata about the authenticated DataONE session.

  .. attribute:: ID

     The AuthToken identifying an authenticated session.  The ID is unique and will
     not be reused for other sessions, and is returned as the result of a
     successful session authentication service call to reference the
     Assertion.

  .. attribute:: IssueInstant

     A date-time value in ISO 8601 format indicating when the session was
     created.

  .. attribute:: Issuer
     
     A URI of a the service that issued the Assertion. For DataONE, this will
     be fixed to the URI of the session management service.

  .. attribute:: Subject

     An identifier of a Principal that is the subject of this Assertion.

  .. attribute:: Address

     The Internet Protocol address from which the authenticated session was
     established, and from which all subsequent requests that utilize this
     Assertion must originate.  IPv4 addresses should be represented their
     dotted decimal format (e.g., 10.0.10.1), while IPv6 addresses are
     represented as their hex values (e.g., fe80::6232:4bfe:fe61:a211).

  .. attribute:: NotBefore

     The date-time value in ISO8601 format before which this session is
     invalid.

  .. attribute:: NotOnOrAfter

     The date-time value in ISO8601 format on which this session is
     invalid.

  .. attribute:: AuthenticationContextClass

     An indication of the mechanism used to perform authentication. Values are
     drawn from known context classes provided in the SAML specifications.

  .. attribute:: GivenName

     The given name of the Person, encoded as a SAML Attribute using LDAP field
     semantics.

  .. attribute:: sn

     The family name of the Person, encoded as a SAML Attribute using LDAP
     field semantics.

  .. attribute:: mail

     The email address of the Person, encoded as a SAML Attribute using LDAP
     field semantics.

  .. attribute:: isMemberOf

     A group or role in which the Principal is a member, expressed using the
     unique Principal identifier for that group, and encoded as a SAML Attribute
     using LDAP field semantics..

  .. attribute:: SessionId

     The AuthToken identifying an authenticated session.  The ID is unique and will
     not be reused for other sessions, and is returned as the result of a
     successful session authentication service call to reference the
     Assertion. Encoded as an a SAML Attribute.

  .. attribute:: EquivalentIdentity

     An alternative but equivalent identity for the principal that has been
     used in alternate identity systems. Encoded as a SAML Attribute with the
     Name of the Attribute set to 'urn:dataone:attributenames:equivalentIdentity'.
