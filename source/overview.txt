Overview
========

The DataONE core cyberinfrastructure implements three significant
functionalities:

1. Persistent identifiers for all discrete objects in the system (i.e. data,
   metadata, system metadata, annotations, identities, node capabilities, and
   so forth). The main goal here is to ensure that an identifier can be used
   reliably in the future without concern about the classic 404-not found
   error encountered with many web sites. Objects are replicated across 
   participant nodes of the DataONE system, so access can generally be 
   guaranteed even if the original node holding the data   goes offline.

2. A consistent scheme for identifying users across all participating nodes.
   It is expected that participants in the DataONE infrastructure will have
   existing systems and requirements for identifying users. One of the goals
   of DataONE is to support synonymous identity by mapping user identities
   between different systems.

3. A substantial, extensible search mechanism to assist discovery. The number
   of objects in DataONE is expected to expand significantly over the years.
   The total is currently undefined and somewhat dependent on the definition
   of a data object, but data object counts in the order of millions is not
   unreasonable. Finding relevant content in such a set of objects obviously
   requires sophisticated search tools that provide accurate and precise
   mechanisms for identifying useful subsets of information. The process for
   search is likely to evolve significantly over the life of the project,
   starting with simple searches against metadata through to more
   sophisticated, semantically aware search.


Additional capabilities, such as mechanisms for sub-setting, transforming, and
slicing data; services for visualizing content; and mechanisms supporting
on-demand services such as remote model and workflow execution will build upon
these core features.

This functionality is available through a set of components, service
interfaces and interactions described in detail in theses document.

There are three major functional components of the DataONE
cyberinfrastructure: Member Nodes (MNs), Coordinating Nodes (CNs), and the Investigator toolkit (ITK).

:Member Nodes:

  Existing and new community data repositories. These systems offer
  heterogeneous implementations across a variety of data types and support a
  variety of metadata types. All data is stored on Member Nodes, and the
  DataONE infrastructure, in particular the Coordinating Nodes assist with
  coordinating distribution of data between MNs. Existing data repositories
  need to implement the DataONE Member Node APIs in order to participate in
  the DataONE network.


:Coordinating Nodes:

  The operational core of DataONE. The Coordinating Nodes catalog data and
  metadata, control the dispersion of data across Member Nodes, keep a replica
  of all metadata, offer services for distributed identity, and offer search
  and discovery capabilities. Coordinating nodes are geographically distinct
  mirror images of each other, operating in a multi-master configuration.


:Investigator Toolkit:

  Initially providing a set of libraries for interacting with DataONE
  Coordinating and Member Nodes (i.e. the "client libraries"). As the project
  develops, the ITK will grow to contain a rich set of applications and tools
  for interacting with the content available in DataONE (and potentially other
  Data Nets).

   Major components of DataONE and the services they implement. It is
   envisioned that there will be few Coordinating Nodes (three initially),
   more Member Nodes (tens ... hundreds), and even more instances of the
   Investigator Toolkit.

   application programming interfaces (APIs) are implemented by a service
   layer that interacts with the existing APIs of the Member Node.
