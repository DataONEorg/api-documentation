Metadata Attributes for Discovery
=================================

.. module:: SearchMetadata

This document describes the attributes pulled from :term:`science metadata`
documents that are used to assist discovery (i.e. search) of content in the DataONE system.


Extracted Search Attributes
---------------------------

Data that exists within the DataONE system is always accompanied by science
metadata in one of the supported metadata schemes (e.g. Dublin Core, EML, or
another supported scheme) and expressed in one of the supported formats (e.g.
XML, RDF-XML). The science metadata is also replicated with the data (where
the Member Node supports the format and scheme) and additional copies are
replicated across the Coordinating Nodes. The science metadata is parsed by
the CNs to extract information to verify the content provides at least the
minimal metadata content and meets consistency requirements. Attributes
extracted from the science metadata are also used to support search
operations.


Searching content in DataONE involves the process of matching a user provided
value with some value extracted from the science metadata.

Values can be simple (e.g. string, integer, floating point, date) or compound
(e.g. spatial coordinate constructed from two floats - the latitude and
longitude and a string - the coordinate system identifier).


Expression in science metadata

Expression in extracted values that are indexed

Expression in a query


Required Query Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Search the authors of content.

Search the keywords of content


Search Element Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Integer

* Float

* String

* DateTime

* SpatialFeature (use `Well Known Text`_ )

* Publication (A structured type, perhaps search by decomposing to elements)

* ScientificName (A structured type, perhaps search by decomposing to elements)


.. _Well Known Text: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text


Essential Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. attribute:: author

   (String)

   - Principle Investigator (PI) / Author

   - Name authority service is desired for some control over names appearing in metadata

   - For search, advantages to keep simple text representation

   - Goal of gradual increase in specificity


.. attribute:: keyWord

   (String)

   - Keyword (uncontrolled keywords)


.. attribute:: keyConcept

   - Key concept -key concepts drawn from a set of ontologies

   - Term

   - Namespace

.. attribute:: spatialFeature

   (SpatialFeature)

   - Spatial bounding box (largest bounding rectangle)

   - Spatial window (series of spatial envelopes representative of the spatial
     locations of where the data is collected from or relevant to)

   - Spatial features (points, bounding boxes, polygons)

   - Centroid

   - Bounding box

   - Polygon

   - (not largest extent)

   - (need to resolve the semantics of the bounding box search - e.g. if centroids are recorded but fall outside of bounding box search)


.. attribute:: namedLocation

   (String)

   - Named places

   - Term 

   - Type 

   - Context (Columbus OH, Columbus GA)

   - Namespace of gazetteer  

.. attribute:: earliestDate

   (DateTime)


.. attribute:: latestDate

   (DateTime)

   - Temporal window

   - Relative terms (e.g. terms from the Geologic time scale) need to be supported

   - Date ranges

   - Temporal coverage of the data set  (e.g. searches - during, before, after)

.. attribute:: any

   (String)

   - Full text search / Text search on abstract


Desirable Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. attribute:: title

   (string)

   - Title (2)

.. attribute:: objectFormat

   (String)

  - Type of data (format) (2)
  
    - Original data

    - Summarized versions

    - Method used for processing (to generate summary, or original data)

    - Resource type (spatial, models, observations, web service, ...)

.. attribute:: variableName

   (String)

   - Scientific variables (from a controlled vocabulary) (1)

.. attribute:: dataDomain

   (String)

   - Domain of data (physics, environmental, ...) (1)


.. attribute:: scientificName

   (String)

   - Biological taxonomic extents (1)

.. attribute:: publication

   (String)

  - Search by publication (1)


Some Others
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. attribute:: creator

   (String)  Dublin core

- Generator of data (instrument, application)

.. attribute:: relatedObject

   (String)

   - Related data (data sets, publications)

.. attribute:: quality

   (String, controlled vocabulary)

   - Quality / level of curation

.. attribute:: relatedOrganizations

   (String)

   - Organizations involved in study

.. attribute:: size

   (Integer, long)

   - Size of data (bytes)

.. attribute:: replicaCount

   (Integer)

.. attribute:: replicaLocation

   (String)

   - Number / location of replicas 

.. attribute:: dimensions

   (Integer or perhaps float?)

   - Dimensionality of data 

.. attribute:: measurementUnits

   (String)

   - Units of measure (for sci variables)

.. attribute:: identifier

   (:class:`Types.IdentifierType`)

   - Identifier (GUID)


.. attribute:: datePublished

.. attribute:: dateCreated

.. attribute:: dateSysMetadataModified

   (DateTime)

  - Temporal coverage, low priority

    - Publication date

    - Creation date

    - Last modified date


.. attribute:: readPrincipal

.. attribute:: writePrincipal

   (:class:`Types.PrincipalType`)

   - Permissions on objects (e.g. available to read by user)
