Event Logging and Reporting
===========================

The DataONE system should log various interactions and operations in the
system to provide operational status information about the entire system, to
report on specific node operations, and to inform DataONE participants (users,
contributors, administrators) about their specific domain of interest in the
system. For example, a contributor might like to monitor use of their data and
where it is being replicated to. The methods :func:MN.getLogRecords and
:func:CN.getLogRecords provide the outward facing methods for retrieving log
information from member and coordinating nodes respectively.

Logging is described in use case 16, 17, 18, 20, and potentially 19.

   LoggingSchema


Use Cases to be Supported
-------------------------

- UC 16 specifies "all CRUD operations on metadata and data are logged at each
  node"

- UC 17 indicates that all CRUD operation logs should be aggregated at the CNs

- UC 18 indicates that a MN can retrieve aggregated logs about content that
  originated from that MN.

- UC 20 indicates that a data owner (original contributor, delegated owner)
  can retrieve aggregated logs about objects they own.

- UC 19 indicates that anyone can retrieve general use information for any
  object in DataONE.


Performance Metrics to be Reported
----------------------------------

The performance metrics survey results from the Leadership Team specify (at
least) the following metrics should be captured. Items that may be captured
from the CI portion of the project are indicated by !!!.


**Size and Diversity of DataONE Data, Metadata, and Investigator Toolkit
Holdings**

1. !!! Data volume – total size of data holdings in DataONE Member Nodes and
   Coordinating Nodes
  
  Recorded in: 
    - Total (including replicas) data volume + unique object data volume 
    - Sysmeta
  
  

2. !!! Number of metadata records – quantity of metadata records held at a
   Coordinating Node (note: the concept of a record may vary across metadata
   standards)

   - science metadata only


3. !!! Number of data sets held by Member Nodes – (note: may be less
   meaningful as an absolute value because of the immense variability in data set
   granularity, but probably still useful in tracking the shape of the data
   accumulation curve)

  - system metadata 


4. !!! Number and types of software tools included in the Investigator Toolkit

  - !!
  - Mechanism to register external uses / implementations
  - HTTP user-agent 


5. !!! Number of different metadata schemas supported – (note: more metadata
   schemas is not necessarily better)

  - object format from sysmeta


**DataONE System Capacity**

6. !!! Number of Member Nodes

  - registry

7. !!! Total storage capacity at Member Nodes

  - per member node
  - total
  - part of MN registration and capabilities

8. !!! Geographic coverage of Member Nodes – continents, regions, and countries
   covered
   
   - could potentially be part of capabilities (record physical location)

9. !!! Number of Coordinating Nodes

   - constant = 3
   - general expansion over five years to all countries.

10. !!! Total storage capacity at Coordinating Nodes

  - disk space

11. !!! Geographic coverage of Coordinating Nodes – continents, regions, and
    countries covered

  - capabilities  / metadata 

**DataONE Usage Statistics**

12. !!! (CN LOG) Number of web hits on DataONE portal

   - standard web hits from logs
   - aggregated across CNs

13. !!! (CN LOG) Number of DataONE users – (note: recording of individual IP
    addresses may be most readily implemented; requiring users to login to Member
    Nodes is not presently required)
    
    - Any users of MNs = D1 user
    - Eventually can use authn subsystem

14. !!! (supporting web site logs) Number of downloads of tools from the
    Investigator Toolkit  --> "Number of times tools are downloaded"
    
    - Log analysis
    - Text needs to be clarified. ITK isn't a place
    - supporting information (videos, documents, ...)

15. !!! (CN LOG) Number of metadata catalog searches completed – (note: over
    time it may also be desirable to assess precision and recall of incoming
    searches)
    
    - part of the Mercury log (in mysql)
    

16. !!! (MN, CN LOG) Number of DataONE datasets downloaded (daily, weekly,
    monthly, annually) – (note: this may be straightforward if included in
    specifications for Member Node data, impossible otherwise)
    
    - Member node access logs - need to be aggregated
    - What was pulled through D1.get() vs the native mechanisms of the MN
    - 

17. !!! (MN, CN LOG) Most frequently downloaded datasets


  - Same as 16


**Reliability and System Performance**

18. !!! (CN heartbeat logs) Uptime (availability) of Coordinating Nodes 

   - Need a monitoring service in addition to the CN service
   - also need to consider geographic accessibility (users)

19. !!! (MN heartbeat logs) Uptime (availability) of Member Nodes – (note:
    tracked if heartbeat is fully implemented)

   - Same as 18

20. !!! Server response time

   - REST service performance
   - Define a bunch of test queries that can be executed in parallel for load testing.


21. !!! Response time of user interface

  - Time for "page load" vs. number of concurrent users
  
  - Time for specific operations (test queries, test renderings, ...)



**Community Engagement**

22. Baseline assessment of scientists completed

23. Number of repeat assessments of scientists completed

24. Baseline assessment of other stakeholders completed

25. Number of repeat assessments of other stakeholders completed

26. Number of DataONE Partnership Agreements established


**Education and Outreach**

27. Number of education modules developed and/or accessible through DataONE

28. Number of times education modules are downloaded

29. Number of best practices guides developed and/or accessible through DataONE

30. Number of times best practices guides are downloaded

31. Number of training sessions or workshops offered (e.g., at meetings)

32. Number of workshop participants

33. Number of people in DataONE International Users Group


**Sustainability**

34. Amount of revenue (including in-kind support) generated annually to
    support DataONE

35. Diversity of revenue streams – e.g., government, private foundations,
    commercial for-profit sector, etc.

36. Number of projects and partners collaborating with DataONE or leveraging
    DataONE infrastructure


Union of Use Cases and Metrics
------------------------------

The following bullets represent the union of logging information indicated in
the use cases and the metrics that can be reported from the logs. The
information logged and suitable summarization and extraction procedures need
to be identified to ensure the following items can be addressed:

- all CRUD operations on metadata and data are logged at each node

- all CRUD operation logs should be aggregated at the CNs

- an MN can retrieve aggregated logs about content that originated from that
  MN.

- A data owner (original contributor, delegated owner) can retrieve aggregated
  logs about objects they own.

- Anyone can retrieve general use information for any object in DataONE.

- (metric) Number of web hits on DataONE portal

- (metric) Number of DataONE users

- (metric) Number of downloads of tools from the Investigator Toolkit (From
  the download site logs)

- (metric) Number of metadata catalog searches completed

- (metric) Number of DataONE datasets downloaded (daily, weekly, monthly,
  annually)
