Use Case 37 - Get System Metadata for Object
--------------------------------------------

Author
  VDC TWG

Date
  - 20100323 [DV] Added new use case as retrieving system metadata was not previously described.

Version 
  0.3

Goal
  Retrieve the :term:`system metadata` for an object identified by some :term:`identifier`.

Summary 

  A client has an identifier for some object within the DataONE system and is
  attempting to retrieve system metadata describing the object. If the object
  exists on the node and the user has READ permission on the object, then the
  bytes of the system metadata object are returned, otherwise an error
  condition occurs.

  Note that Member Nodes do not store authoritative copies of system metadata,
  but they still need to implement this operation.

Actors
  - Client requesting object
  - Coordinating Node
  - Member Node

Preconditions 
  - Client has authenticated to the desired level (e.g. client may not have
    authenticated, so access might be anonymous).

Triggers
  - System metadata is requested from the DataONE system.

Post Conditions
  - The client has a copy of the system metadata document (or an error message
    in the case of failure)
