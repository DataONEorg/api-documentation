Implementation Roadmap
======================

The DataONE project has an initial lifetime of five years, starting August
2009. Over this time development will occur in three major phases:

:Prototyping:

  August 2009 - July 2010. Prototyping activity occurred during the first year
  of the project and was used to evaluate fundamental infrastructure design
  decisions. Although the prototype period has passed, some prototyping
  activity will continue as a mechanism for evaluating new functionality.

:First public release:

  Targeted for the end of 2011, the first public release of the infrastructure
  will be labelled "version 1.0" and will support the core DataONE functionality
  including replication, identifier resolution, search and discovery, and
  federated identity.

:Second major release:

  Subsequent to the first public release will be a series of minor releases
  that progressively add functionality to the core infrastructure. It is
  anticipated that a streamlining and refactoring process will lead to another
  major release (version 2.0) towards the end of 2013.



Version Numbering
-----------------

There are many discrete products that together form the DataONE
cyberinfrastructure. Each of these products may follow their own version
steps, however the version of the infrastructure being matched should be
indicated using the DataONE cyberinfrastructure version identifier.

Version numbers are expressed in three parts: Major.Minor.Revision to reflect
official releases of the software, where:

:Major:

  Is a significantly different release from the previous version number, may
  provide significant additional features and may implement functionality that
  is not backwards compatible with prior releases.

:Minor:

  Adds additional features to an existing release and maintains compatibility
  within the current major version.

:Revision:

  Indicates a minor change from the current version, typically used to provide
  bug fix releases. Will not usually add additional functionality.
