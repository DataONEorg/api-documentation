-------------------------------

dataoneTypes.xsd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following changes were enacted on the dataoneTypes.xsd schema as a result
of discussions during the DataONE all-hands meeting held during the week of
October 18, 2011.

No further significant changes to dataonetypes.xsd are expected for version
1.0.0 of the DataONE infrastructure.

- unsigned long "serialversion" element added to the
  :class:`Types.SystemMetadata` complex type. The *serialVersion* value is
  incremented upon any updates to a system metadata instance, and is used to
  indicate which is the current version (highest *serialVersion* is always the
  latest) of system metadata for an object.

- "fmtid" change to "formatId" in :class:`Types.SystemMetadata` complex type

- "fmtid" change to "formatId" in :class:`Types.ObjectFormat` complex type 

- "fmtid" change to "formatId" in :class:`Types.ObjectInfo` complex type 

- email minOccurs change from 1 to 0 in :class:`Types.Person` complex type

- boolean "verified" property added to :class:`Types.Person` complex type.
  This value is *true* if the name and email address of the Person have been
  verified to ensure that the *givenName* and *familyName* represent the real
  person's legal name, and that the email address is correct for that person
  and is in the control of the indicated individual. Verification occurs
  through a established procedure within DataONE as part of the Identity
  Management system.

- Numerous annotation edits and updates
