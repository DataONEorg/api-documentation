command for general and the *blame* command for more specific change details.
If a copy of the document source has been checked out locally::

  svn log <<file name>>
  svn blame <<file name>>

or remotely::

  svn log https://repository.dataone.org/documents/Projects/cicore/architecture/api-documentation/<<file name>>
  svn blame https://repository.dataone.org/documents/Projects/cicore/architecture/api-documentation/<<file name>>

History for this file for example can be obtained by::
