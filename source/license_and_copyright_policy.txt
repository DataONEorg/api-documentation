License and Copyright Policy
============================

DataONE is developing software and distributing software that originates from
multiple institutions that each have their own policies governing copyright and
licensing of software. As a project, we are committed both philosophically and
through our cooperative agreement with NSF to distribute our work as open source
software. However, we must do so within the guidelines provided by each of our
institutions. This document outlines our general policy towards the assignment
of copyright and licensing of software developed as a part of DataONE
activities.

Copyright
---------
Individuals employed by different universities contribute to the development of
DataONE software, and generally those individuals or the institution that
employs them would hold copyright on their work. The subcontract agreements
between DataONE organizations has a special condition that states that
subcontractors will grant a license to work to enable the Prime Recipient to 
meets its obligations to NSF, but it does not transfer copyright in any way.
However, essentially all DataONE software products have been and will continue
to be jointly designed and created by individuals spread across the DataONE
participating institutions. No one individual or institution can claim creative
ownership of any of the DataONE software products. Therefore, our general
policy will be that each DataONE software product will contain a copyright
statement that indicates that all of the participating organizations hold joint
copyright in the work.

An alternative approach to joint copyright was also considered in which
individual contributors and their institutions would assign copyright to a
holding entity that would ensure the long-term availability of the
copyrighted materials. We did not feel that an existing University should
play this role, but there was some agreement that a 501(c)(3) entity that had 
appropriate language built into its charter documents that would guarantee 
perpetual availability of the copyrighted material would be appropriate. No
such entity currently exists, and the institutional agreements to contribute
copyrighted materials would need to be worked out, so we felt this solution
would not work for our short term needs, but should be considered for our
longer-term strategy. We noted that existing groups like the Apache Software
Foundation use this model effectively for cross-institutional development,
although it does take overhead to create and maintain the institutional
arrangements that make this model possible. Joint copyright is simpler if
only because it is the de facto state of our products when multiple
institutions contribute to development.

Open source licensing
---------------------
Because DataONE is committed to open science and open source principles, all
software developed will be licensed under an approved open source license.
Because different open source licenses can have implications for the re-use and
distribution of that software, we want to have a general policy that guides
choice of licenses. However, we also recognize that existing software that we
may wish to use may already contain existing open source licenses that can not
be changed easily or at all, and we do not want as a matter of policy to exclude
the use of these open source products.

We recognize the benefits of various open source licenses, but as a general
policy DataONE will use the Apache 2.0 open source license for all newly
developed code: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php. The Apache
license was selected because it:

* Grants a copyright license that allows any party to download, copy, and modify the work 
* Grants a patent license for any party to use, modify, and redistribute the work
* Includes a disclaimer that the software is distributed without warranty
* Inlcudes a limitation of liability

We also considered other licenses which were not selected, including the BSD
license (no patent license) and the GPL (includes requirement that derivative
works also be GPL licensed).

We recognize that DataONE will likely need to incorporate other existing
software products into the system, and this general license policy should not be
used to exclude open source software from use within DataONE. Rather, DataONE
participants can incorporate software to the extent permitted by their licenses
and can contribute to other software products that use alternate licenses when
it will benefit the DataONE project. Questions should be directed to the
DataONE Leadership Team.

Copyright and license notification
----------------------------------
As a consequence, each DataONE product should include a copyright and license
statement in a file at the root of the source and binary distributions and in
each source code file that reads::
    
   This work was created by participants in the DataONE project, and is 
   jointly copyrighted by participating institutions in DataONE. For 
   more information on DataONE, see our web site at http://dataone.org.

root of its source code tree in order to make the license easily accessible to
people that receive the product.

  Copyright and patent policies for individual institutions
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  
  University of Tennessee
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  The University's policy on such issues is here:  http://utrf.tennessee.edu/faculty/forms/IP_Policy.PDF  Section E.1 is relevant, page 4. The gist
  is that the agreement from UNM is dominant.   I don't have a copy of that agreement handy, but UT also lists a goal that the results of the work
  available to industry and the public on an effective and nondiscriminatory basis. The document seems mostly concerned with whether faculty and
  staff have rights to work done while employed by UT.
  
  Based on what I'm reading and examples, the correct format for the copyright statement for UT contributions is
  Copyright (year) The University of Tennessee
  
  The College of Communication and Information has rights too since the School of Information Sciences and the Center for Communication and Information Studies is involed. Carol Tenopir suggested a statement such as 
  
  Copyright (year) College of Communication and Information Â· The University of Tennessee
  
  Oak Ridge National Laboratory
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  ORNL is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), currently operated by UT-Battelle (a 50/50 joint venture LLC between Battelle
  Memorial Institute and the University of Tennessee). Based on what I've read, we should be OK to go ahead and assert copyright, though there is a
  technical requirement to get DOE permission. I need to see what's in the actual contract from UNM, and I'm checking that question.
  
  The correct format for our copyright is
  Copyright (year) UT-Battelle, LLC
  
  University of California, Santa Barbara
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  UCSB policy on copyright is here:
  http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/policy/8-19-92att.html
  
  Note in particular sections IV.D and V.
  
  NESCent and Duke University 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  Duke's intellectual property policies are here:
  http://www.provost.duke.edu/pdfs/intelProp.pdf
  
  Todd Vision says:
  We discussed this policy with Duke's legal folks ~5 yrs ago, and the
  agreed interpretation of that language is that, since research
  software at NESCent is not commissioned by Duke or serving a
  'utilitarian' purpose within the institution, the copyright for that
  software vests with the individual creators, unless the grant
  explicitly specifies some other arrangement....So with DataONE
  products, we are like UT Knoxville, in that whatever terms DataONE
  decides will govern the software produced in that collaboration. And
  if nothing is decided, the copyright to any work that Ryan creates
  under DataONE is assigned to Ryan.
