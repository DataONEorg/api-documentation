License and Copyright Policy
============================

DataONE is developing software and distributing software that originates from
multiple institutions that each have their own policies governing copyright and
licensing of software. As a project, DataONE is committed both philosophically and
through our cooperative agreement with NSF to distribute our work as open source
software. This document outlines our general policy towards the assignment
of copyright and licensing of software developed as a part of DataONE
activities.

Open source licensing
---------------------
Because DataONE is committed to open science and open source principles, all
software developed will be licensed under an OSI-approved open source license.
Because different open source licenses can have implications for the re-use and
distribution of that software, DataONE will have a general policy that guides
choice of licenses. However, DataONE also recognizes that existing software that is
useful to the project may already use open source licenses that can not
be changed easily or at all. DataONE does not want as a matter of policy to exclude
the use of these open source products that use alternate licenses.

DataONE recognizes the benefits of various open source licenses, but as a general
policy DataONE will use the Apache 2.0 open source license for newly
developed code: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php. The Apache
license was selected because it:

* Grants a copyright license that allows any party to download, copy, and modify the work 
* Grants a patent license for any party to use, modify, and redistribute the work
* Includes a disclaimer that the software is distributed without warranty
* Inlcudes a limitation of liability

DataONE also considered other licenses which were not selected, including the BSD
license (no patent license) and the GPL (includes requirement that derivative
works also be GPL licensed).

In addition, DataONE will need to incorporate other existing
software products into the system, and this general license policy should not be
used to exclude open source software from use within DataONE. Rather, DataONE
participants can incorporate OSI-compliant software to the extent permitted by their licenses
and can contribute to other software products that use alternate licenses when
it will benefit the DataONE project. Questions should be directed to the
DataONE Leadership Team.

Copyright
---------
Individuals employed by different universities contribute to the development of
DataONE software, and those individuals or the institution that
employs them hold copyright on their work. Typically authorship of DataONE software
is done by participants from multiple institutions holding joint copyright. Therefore, 
our general policy will be that each DataONE software product will contain a copyright
statement that indicates that all of the participating organizations hold joint
copyright in the work.

Copyright and license notification
----------------------------------
As a consequence, each DataONE product should include a copyright and license
statement in a file at the root of the source and binary distributions and in
each source code file that reads::
    
   This work was created by participants in the DataONE project, and is 
   jointly copyrighted by participating institutions in DataONE. For 
   more information on DataONE, see our web site at http://dataone.org.

people that receive the product.
