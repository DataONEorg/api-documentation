Content Discovery
=================

.. module:: SearchMetadata

.. currentmodule:: SearchMetadata

.. contents::

Searching for content is a functionality that is primarily supported by
Coordinating Nodes, programmatically through the CN_read.search method, and
through a web browser interface that connects through a UI to a SOLR_ index.

This document describes the properties of the SOLR index, how it is populated,
and how it can be used to support programmatic search and introspection into the
DataONE holdings.

The SOLR index is currently populated from content that is stored on
Coordinating Nodes which includes System Metadata, Science Metadata and Resource
Maps. The basic model is that each index entry represents information about the
information referenced by a single identifier (PID). For PIDs that refer to
science data object, the index entry will be constructed from system metadata
and zero or more resource maps that reference the object. If the PID refers to a
science metadata object, the index entry will have fields populated with content
extracted from the science metadata document and zero or more resource maps that
reference the science metadata.


Properties of the Index Derived From System Metadata
----------------------------------------------------

Table 1 provides a list of SOLR attributes that are populated by values taken
from System Metadata.

**Table 1.** Elements derived from System Metadata and available for all
objects. "Multi" fields may be populated with more than a single value per
document (PID) indexed.

.. sqltable:: System Metadata Properties
   :header: Attribute,Type,Multi?,Content Origin
   :widths: 3 2 1 10
   :driver: xlsx
   :source: source/design/data/SearchFields.xlsx
   :sql: SELECT ':attr:`SearchMetadata.'||SOLR||'`', FieldType, Multi, ValueOrigin FROM Fields WHERE Fields.Source='Y';



Populating Permission Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This process is fairly straight forward, and requires simply de-duping entries
so that each of the permission fields contains a distinct list of subjects
granted that permission. If the DataONE :term:`public user` is present in the
read permissions, then the *isPublic* field is set to True.


Properties of the Index Derived from Resource Maps
--------------------------------------------------

Table 2 provides a list of SOLR attributes that are populated by values obtained
by parsing resource map objects.

**Table 2.** Elements derived from Resource Map documents. "Multi" fields may be
populated with more than a single value per document (PID) indexed.

.. sqltable:: Resource Map Properties
   :header: Attribute,Type,Multi?,Content Origin
   :widths: 3 2 1 10
   :driver: xlsx
   :source: source/design/data/SearchFields.xlsx
   :sql: SELECT ':attr:`SearchMetadata.'||SOLR||'`', FieldType, Multi, ValueOrigin FROM Fields WHERE Fields.Source='R';



Populating Object Relation Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fields *resourceMaps*, *contains*, *documents*, and *isDocumentedBy* contain
identifiers of other objects in the DataONE system related to the subject of
the current record. These relationships are recorded in OAI-ORE resource map
documents as described in the section :doc:`DataPackage`. Since the values for
these fields are contained in resource maps, it is necessary to build these
fields in progression as additional resource maps are synchronized with the
coordinating nodes.

For each object, a query is issued against the index to retrieve the list of
resource maps in which the object identifier is present, enabling population of
the *resourceMaps* field for the object. Each of those resource maps is examined
to obtain the list of identifiers for the *documents* field if the object is
science metadata, and the *isDocumentedBy* field if the object is data.

**Example Sequence for Index Population**

The following sequence steps through the generation of index entries for three
data packages, providing an example of how the index entries are updated
depending on relationships between the objects being added.


Adding Package 1

Limitations of Multi-Valued Fields in SOLR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multi-valued fields in SOLR have an internal representation that can be
likened to a delimited concatenation of all the values for the field. The
fields have a configurable limit to the maximum field size, and this limit may
be encountered in the various entries such as the permission fields or object
relation fields where a potentially large number of subjects or identifiers
may be stored. Further research has indicated this problem is unlikely since
simply increasing the SOLR *maxFieldLength* configuration value will enable
larger field content, with examples in the wild of several thousand entries
equivalent to DataONE identifiers in a single field.

Values Extracted from Science Metadata
--------------------------------------

Indexing the system metadata entries provides a mechanism for selection of
content using low level attributes of the objects such as the type, size and
relationships, however is not useful for locating content relevant to a
particular topic or purpose. The :term:`science metadata` contains such
information and the index records associated with these documents contain
additional information described below.

The initial web user interface to DataONE utilizes the Mercury_ system. This
in turn relies upon a SOLR index to support the search, faceting, and
sub-setting operations that are exposed through Mercury. The underlying SOLR
index is also exposed through as an API, so other clients (such as the file
system driver) can leverage the search capabilities thus provided.

The remainder of this document describes the search properties that are
extracted from the various formats and syntaxes of of science metadata that
are supported by the DataONE indexing system.

.. attribute:: abstract

   The abstract text as provided in the science metadata document.


.. attribute:: auth_mn

.. attribute:: author

   Principle Investigator (PI) / Author as listed in the metadata document. 

   For search there are advantages to keep simple text representation, with
   general goal of gradual increase in specificity. Desireable to provide "sort
   friendly" results such as using LAST, FIRST name.


.. attribute:: author_lname

   Last (family or surname) name of the Author


.. attribute:: beginDate

   - temporalCoverageStart
   - temporal extent
   - "jurassic" vs "date collected for jurassic specimen"
   - not publication date, not creation date
   - Applicability date (as opposed to collection date or publication date -- though searching on collection date is a secondary search).  Multiple dates possible:  Collection/observation date, coverage date, analysis date, publication date, metadata modification date (e.g. peat bog samples relevant to 50,000 - 10,000 BCE, collected in July 1980, re-analyzed in July 2008, published in January 2010, and metadata revised in June 2010).  In this example, earliestDate applies to 50,000 BCE.

**Notes**

:Version:

  There is no clear recommendation on how to express version. For an object
  with a linear revision history (A is obsoleted by B is obsoleted by C),
  object C might be considered to have a version of "2". However, it is
  possible for an object to have a tree lineage (A1 and A2 are obsoleted by
  B1, and B1, A3 and Z are obsoleted by C). A suggestion for a version
  indicator in this case may be the total number of parent objects, 5 in this
  case. Another option may be to indicate the number of contributing objects
  at each revision, 1.1 in the first case, and 2.3 in the second.


:Publisher:

  The publisher in DataONE may in some cases be the origin member node,
  however this will not always be the case. For example, many data sets in the
  KNB are published by LTER, though KNB would be the member node. Where
  possible the publisher information should be pulled from the science
  metadata, though this may be complicated where multiple data and metadata
  entries occur within a data package and there are several publishers listed.
  In this case, a simple concatenation of the publishers (semi-colon + space
  delimited) may be sufficient.


:Date:

  In the DataCite 2.2 document, a mapping between Date and the dcterms:date is
  suggested. The description of dcterms:date is "A point or period of time
  associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource." In DataONE there
  are two main dates related to an object, when the content is added to the
  system, and when the properties of the object (access control, and so forth)
  are modified. Since the content of the object does not change once submitted
  to DataONE, the :attr:`SystemMetadata.dateUploaded` value seems appropriate
  here, expressed as :attr:`dateUploaded` in the search index.


:Subset Used:

  DataONE does not provide a mechanism for identifying sets of information
  other than through resource maps which describe data packages. It is
  possible that a resource map may contain references to additional resource
  maps, conceptually equivalent to subsets of content. The simplest option
  here would be to use the identifier of the resource map object describing
  the package in question.


:Contributor:

  Described in DataCite 2.2 as "The institution or person responsible for
  collecting, creating, or otherwise contributing to the development of the
  dataset", this optional element can be populated by the citeinfo/origin
  element from FGDC.


:Publication Place:

  In CSDGM, "the name of the city (and state or province, and country, if
  needed to identify the city) where the data set was published or released".


:Data Within a Larger Work:

  This is similar to the "Subset Used" entry except in the other direction of
  containment. The identifier of the containing resource map relevant to the
  current package should be used.

  NOTES etc (not rendered below)

  Searching content in DataONE involves the process of matching a user provided
  value with some value extracted from the science metadata.

  Values can be simple (e.g. string, integer, floating point, date) or compound
  (e.g. spatial coordinate constructed from two floats - the latitude and
  longitude and a string - the coordinate system identifier).
