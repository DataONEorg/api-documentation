Authorization and Authentication in DataONE
===========================================

Authorization vs. Authentication: A Primer
-------------------------------------------
The process of confirming whether a user has privileges to access a resource 
or use a service is called *authorization*.  *Authentication* is the process of 
determining whether or not a user is who they say they are. Both are required of
a security architecture to ensure that the right people have the right access to 
resources and services.

Authorization is achieved through the association of Subjects (usernames) and 
permissions with the resources and services being secured.  Typically, this is 
done using access control lists (ACL). When a request is made, the identity of 
the user is looked up in the ACL, and the appropriate action is taken based on 
the user's permissions.  DataONE uses Subjects contained in a resource's 
SystemMetadata, as well as Subjects in the Authoritative Member Node's Node
document when making authorization decisions.  The latter is used primarily for
administrative actions and to secure services.

In authentication, the user provides their username along with 
other information that gives assurances that they are who they say they are.  
Typical computer logon accounts are examples of authentication, where the password 
serves as the information used to assure a user's identity.  Username-password 
systems over the internet need to be a bit more complicated than that, in that 
even the username and password have to be secured before sending them to the 
remote server.  That is, the user needs to authenticate the remote server and 
encrypt her confidential information before sending it.  X.509 has emerged as the 
de-facto standard used to do this, and is what DataONE uses for authentication.

X.509 Authentication
--------------------
X.509 is a public infrastructure that provides for a way to trust newly-encountered
entities through a strict chain-of-trust system.  It works though a public key 
infrastructure where trusted third parties known as Certificate Authorities (CA)
issue certificates to entities that they can send to end-users and use for encrypted
communication.  Through chain-of-trust, if the issuing CA (who's identity is 
contained in the certificate sent to the end-user) is trusted by the end-user, 
then the end-user trusts the entity sending them the certificate.  Major internet 
browsers come prepackaged with a set of CA certificates from well-established and 
reputable CAs.
 

For example, VeriSign and Thawte are two well-known CAs.  Imagine a bank purchases
a certificate from VeriSign to use in online transactions with customers.  When 
customers connect to the bank's web-site, their browser receives the bank's 
certificate, and traces the signing chain, finding VeriSign as the signer. If it 
finds the VeriSign certificate in its local trusted CA list, then it trusts that 
the certificate it just received is the bank's, and can authenticate the connection.  
Otherwise, authentication fails, and the web page is not loaded. (At this point, 
some browsers appeal to the user that it doesn't trust the signer of the certificate, 
and asks the user if they should, by adding the signer to their list of trusted CAs.)



DataONE Authentication
----------------------
In the above example, the end-user provides a username and password to authenticate
themselves, while the web-server authenticates itself to the end-user using a 
certificate.  This approach doesn't work in the distributed DataONE environment,
where servers communicate with other servers, as well as end-users.  Instead,
DataONE relies on both end-users and servers (the MNs and CNs) to use these X.509 
certificates to authenticate themselves, and relies on CILogon to provide 
certificates to end-users.

The use of CILogon has two main advantages for end-users.  First, they can use existing
accounts to obtain certificates, so don't need to create and remember another 
username and password combination.  Second, once they have downloaded the 
certificate, it will secure connections with all DataONE nodes throughout
the day, and can be used by multiple DataONE applications.  This technique is 
known as single-sign-on.

CILogon certificates issued for DataONE also have a third feature: they include
additional DataONE Subjects mapped to the certificate's Subject through DataONE's
identity management service, the DataONE Portal.  In a nutshell, a DataONE identity
is the set of user accounts and groups that a person maintains.

Member Node Client Certificates
--------------------------------
Both CNs and MNs are expected to trust DataONE and CILogon-signed certificates,
as well as commercial certificates. DataONE issues DataONE-signed certificates 
to MNs when they register their node to facilitate association of the certificate
Subject with the NodeID, which is involved in some authorization decisions.


Trust Relationships
--------------------

When issuing requests, two types of certificates are used: CILogon-signed and 
DataONE-signed certificates.  In all cases, the requester can expect a 
commercially-signed certificate from the server.

===================  ========================  ==============
Client / Requester    CA of certificate         trusted CAs
===================  ========================  ==============
End-user              CILogon (short-lived)     commercial         
-------------------  ------------------------  --------------
Coordinating Node     DataONE (long-lived)      commercial
-------------------  ------------------------  --------------
Member Node           DataONE (long-lived)      commercial
===================  ========================  ==============



From a server perspective, only CILogon or DataONE certificates are used
for communication (or no certificate).  Both CNs and MNs are expected to trust
CILogon and DataONE certificates.

===================  ===================  ===================
Server                CA of certificate    trusted CAs
