Analysis and modeling tools
===========================
Quantitiative analysis is at the center of all science, and represents the main
point where scientists utilize data and produce derived data products. Thus, the
analysis and modeling tools in the Investigator Toolkit will represent the most
important suite of tools for accessing data from DataONE and contributing
results to the DataONE Member Nodes.

We will select a variety of both general purpose and discipline-specific
analysis and modeling tools, and will incorporate support for the DataONE
service API into these tools so that they can seamlessly access DataONE.
