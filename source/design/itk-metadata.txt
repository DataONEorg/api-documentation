Metadata and Data Management Tools
==================================

Morpho
------

Metadata management using Morpho. Morpho allows scientists to create metadata,
(i.e. describe their data in a standardized format), and create a catalog of
data and metadata upon which to query, edit and view data collections in order
to improve local organization of a scientistâ€™s data. Morpho can be used
without a network connection to accommodate data management at remote field
sites, and it also can access Metacat servers on the network in order to share
data with colleagues, and find and retrieve relevant ecological data from the
broader community. Morpho supports a wide variety of users in North America
and other countries, and includes a metadata editing interface that has been
translated into Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, French, and Japanese. The
metadata it collects is based on Ecological Metadata Language, but it can also
export metadata to other common specifications like the Biological Data
Profile. DataONE is adapting Morpho to be used as a metadata and data
management tool that can create and curate metadata and data on any of the
DataONE compliant Member Nodes.
