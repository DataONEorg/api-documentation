Node Identity and Registration
==============================

.. contents::

DataONE nodes are of two types, Coordinating Nodes and Member Nodes. Member Nodes
are data and metadata providers that serve particular communities and that 
agree to interoperate with other nodes using the DataONE Service Interface.
Coordinating Nodes provide services to each other and to the network of Member 
Nodes to enable DataONE to function as an integrated federation.

Node Identifiers
----------------
Each node in DataONE is assigned a unique, immutable identifier which serves to
link all information about the node together in the system.  References in various
metadata documents in DataONE always utilize this NodeReference, as this will
remain constant even as protocols and service endpoints evolve over time.  Thus,
while the URL endpoint for a node's services may change over time, possibly even
moving across domains, the NodeReference will always be constant.  The DataONE 
NodeReference takes the following form::

    NodeReference = urn ":" node ":" identifier
    urn           = "urn"
    node          = "node"
    identifier    = *( idchars )
    idchars       = ALPHA / DIGIT / "_"
      
ALPHA and DIGIT are patterns representing the upper and lower ASCII letters [A-Za-z] and the
ASCII digits [0-9], defined in the ABNF_ standard.
Thus, ``urn:node:`` is a constant prefix, always in lowercase, and ``identifier``
is a short, unique name for the node that is case sensitive.  For example, 
valid NodeReferences might include::

    urn:node:KNB
    urn:node:DRYAD
    urn:node:CN_UCSB

By policy, the length of nodes identifiers will generally be restricted to 25 characters, and
will be reviewed for appropriateness for the node during the node approval process
see `Node Registration`_ below).

Node Authentication and Contact
-------------------------------
In order to become a Member Node (or Coordinating Node) in DataONE, the node must be
able to be authenticated in order to be able to securely communicate with other nodes
in the network using the DataONE service interface.  Thus, the first step in becoming
a node is to request a DataONE node certificate that can be used to authenticate the node.
This certificate is an X.509 certificate that is backed by a cryptographic key.  The
certificate will contain the subject name of the node, which can be used to refer to the
node.  Over time, these node certificates will expire and will need to be renewed by
associating the new certificate with the NodeRefernce for this node.  Thus, the Node
description provided in DataONE can contain a list of nodeSubjects, each of which 
corresponds to a valid DataONE certificate that can be used to authenticate the node
for service operations.

In addition, every node must have a contact person with whom DataONE can communicate
about DataONE operations and policies as needed.  In order to register, the Distinguished
Name for this person must be provided at registration.

Node Registration
-----------------
Registration as a node in the DataONE network is accomplished by registering as a
Member Node (or Coordinating Node) through an existing Coordinating Node 
registration service (see :func:`CNRegister.register`). This service takes a :class:`Types.Node` 
description as input, including
a proposed :class:`Types.NodeReference` for this node and additional metadata such as the nodeContact
in the Node description.   If the NodeReference is syntactically correct and is unique, and
the nodeContact is a verified account registered with DataONE, then
the registration service will successfully return the :class:`Types.NodeReference` value for this node, which is
then permanently assigned and can not be reused or reassigned.  At this point, the
the :class:`Types.Node` has been registered but has not yet been approved.  The request to become a
node will be reviewed by DataONE, and, if approved, will be added to the list of
Nodes in the federation.  At this point, the Node will be be able to participate in
all synchronization and replication services available in DataONE.
