-----------------------------------------

Author
  VDC TWG

Date
  - 20091126 [PEA] Make consistent with V0.3 API documentation.
  - 20090925 Adding to use case description and documentation
  - 20090114 (TWG meeting).  Subsequent various modifications.

Version 
  0.3

Goal
  All CRUD logs are aggregated at coordinating nodes.

Summary 

  Aggregation of CRUD operation logs is used to compute use statistics and
  other summary types of information. The original log information should be
  viewable by administrators for some period of time.
  
  The particular information required to be logged still needs to be specified 
  so that MNs know what specific information needs to be collected as part of 
  Use Case 16.


Actors

  - Member Node(s)

  - Coordinating Node


Preconditions 

  - CNs are operational

Triggers

  - Timed event, logs are aggregated every 24 hours.

Post Conditions

  - Aggregate logs are stored on Coordinating Node

  - Logs are synchronized between CNs

  - Log processing is triggered on CNs
