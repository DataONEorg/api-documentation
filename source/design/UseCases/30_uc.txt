Goal
  MN can notify CN about pending outages, severity, and duration, and CNs may
  want to act on that knowledge to maintain seamless operation.

Summary
  It is likely that Member Nodes will need to be taken offline from time to
  time for maintenance or other planned outages. There should be a mechanism
  for Member Nodes to notify Coordinating Nodes of the impending outage so that
  the Coordinating Nodes can adjust replication of content to ensure ongoing
  availability. The migration of content should be tempered with the duration
  of the outage and the number of existing copies of content available on
  other node. For short durations outages, the expense of moving the content
  around may not be justified. However, for lengthy outages, it would be
  preferable to replicate as much content as practical to ensure ongoing
  access.

Actors
  - Member Node
  - Member Node administrator
  - Coordinating Nodes
  - Coordinating Node administrators

Preconditions
  - Member Node is participating in the DataONE federation
  - Content stored on the Member Node needs to be available while offline

Triggers
  - A Member Node needs to be taken offline

Post Conditions
  - A decision has been made on which content to replicate from the Member
    Node
  - Content is replicated from the Member Node
  - Notification to the Member Node operator of replication completion is
    provided
