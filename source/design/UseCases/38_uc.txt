Use Case 38 - Reserve an Identifier
-----------------------------------

Author

Date
  - 20100330 [DV] Added use case

Version 
  0.3

Goal 
  Reserve an identifier to ensure it is available at some reasonable time in
  the future.

Summary 
  As new content is added to the DataONE system, it is desirable to reserve an
  identifier in advance of creating the content as it is necessary for the
  client to generate relationships between content that may not exist in the
  DataONE system (e.g. a new data set with associated science metadata).

Actors
  ITK, Coordinating Node

Preconditions 
  - CN and MN operational
  
Triggers
  - A client needs to reserve an identifier so that associations can be
    created in the system metadata

Post Conditions
  - An identifier is reserved and guaranteed to be unique for some finite
    period of time.

   Use case 38. Note that id a Member Node needs to reserve an identifier then
   it would use the functioanlity of the Investigator Toolkit Library - that
   is, the reserveIdentifier operation is not required for Member Node
   functionality.

   Sequence diagram for use case 38. The Coordinating Node needs to keep track
   of identifiers that have been reserved, and this information needs to be
   replicated between Coordinating Nodes. The reserved identifier should not
   be discoverable and should not be involved with any Member Node
   synchronization or Member Node replication.

  itk -> c_crud: reserveIdentifier(token, guid, scope, format)
  c_crud -> c_crud: createDummyEntry
  note right
    A dummy entry is created in the object store as a place holder.
    This entry should not be retrievable through search or other 
    discovery mechanisms.
