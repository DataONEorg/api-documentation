Author

Date
  - 20090925 Adding to use case description and documentation
  - 20090114 (TWG meeting).  Subsequent various modifications.

Version 
  Draft

Goal
  General public can request aggregated download usage information for any
  object ID (with anonymous read access)

Summary 

  This operation provides an indication of the popularity for an object in
  DataONE, somewhat equivalent to a citation index for a publication.

Actors

  - Anonymous user

  - Coordinating Node

Preconditions 

  Use statistics have been recorded for a given object
  
Triggers
  - Any user requests use logs for an object

Post Conditions

  - Requesting user has a copy of use statistics for an object (if
    authorized).


.. uml::

   actor User
   participant "Client" as app_client << Application >>
   User -> app_client
   participant "Authentication API" as c_authenticate << Coordinating Node >>
   app_client -> c_authenticate: login (user, pw)
   app_client <-- c_authenticate: token or failure
   participant "Query API" as c_query << Coordinating Node >>
   app_client -> c_query: usageQuery (token, GUID)
   participant "Authorization API" as c_authorize << Coordinating Node >>
   c_query -> c_authorize: isAuth (token, resultset)
   c_query <-- c_authorize: T or F
   app_client <-- c_query: download usage records
   note right
   Can the Query API handle queries
   on log records or should this be
   handled by another API?
   (e.g. "Report API"?)
   end note
