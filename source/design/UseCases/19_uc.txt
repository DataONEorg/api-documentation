   actor User
   participant "Client" as app_client << Application >>
   User -> app_client
   participant "Authentication API" as c_authenticate << Coordinating Node >>
   app_client -> c_authenticate: login (user, pw)
   app_client <-- c_authenticate: token or failure
   participant "Query API" as c_query << Coordinating Node >>
   app_client -> c_query: usageQuery (token, PID)
   participant "Authorization API" as c_authorize << Coordinating Node >>
   c_query -> c_authorize: isAuth (token, resultset)
   c_query <-- c_authorize: T or F
   app_client <-- c_query: download usage records
   note right
   Can the Query API handle queries
   on log records or should this be
   handled by another API?
   (e.g. "Report API"?)
   end note
