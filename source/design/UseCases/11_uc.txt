Version 
  Draft

Goal
  Create / update / delete / search workflow objects.

Summary 

  This use case describes the management of a workflow object within the
  DataONE infrastructure.

  *Note:* It is not clear why this should be treated any differently from the
  management of regular objects. A workflow should be treated like any other
  object within DataONE as far as object management, replication, preservation
  and discovery are concerned. Some additional features to support workflow
  staging and execution may emerge as separate use cases.
