-----------------------------

Author

Date
  - 20090930 Flagged as dupe
  - 20090925 Adding to use case description and documentation
  - 20090114 (TWG meeting).  Subsequent various modifications.

Version 
  Draft

Goal
  Batch Operations - Coordinating Node requests metadata /data list from new
  Member Node and then batch upload (disable indexing for example to improve
  insert performance).

Summary

  This is a dupe of Use Case 06 after refactoring that
  use case use a pull mechanism to retrieve changed records. The intent is to
  streamline the retrieval of large amounts of content from a MN, which
  perhaps involves turning of indexing and other potentially time consuming
  operations to speed the upload process.


Actors

  - CN

  - MN

Preconditions 

  - Large amount of metadata data is required to be uploaded to the CN
  
Triggers

  - Indication of a large amount of content to retrieves from a MN

Post Conditions

  - The upload is completed, CN synchronization is completed, MN replication
    is scheduled.
