Goal
  Get list of PIDs from metadata search (anonymous and authenticated).

Summary 
  A user performs a search against the DataONE system and receives a list of
  object identifiers (PIDs) that match the search criteria. The list of PIDs
  is filtered such that only objects for which the user has read permission
  will be returned.

  Content discovery in DataONE is achieved primarily through the service
  interfaces provided by the Coordinating Nodes. Other systems may index
  content available in DataONE (:doc:`UC36<36_uc>`), though the
  operation of those systems is out of scope for DataONE operations except 
  that the exposed APIs enable such functionality.

Actors
  - Client performing search operation
  - Coordinating Node

Preconditions 
  - Client has authenticated to at the desired level (e.g. client may not have
    authenticated, so access might be anonymous).

Triggers
  - A search is performed against the DataONE system
 
Post Conditions

  - The client has a list of PIDs (:class:`Types.objectList`) for which they
    have permission to read and match the supplied query or an error condition.

  - The log is updated with information about the request

vary (e.g. by augmenting the query used for searching).

     The query response is a list of PIDs.
     Each ID needs to be checked for read 
     access by the authenticated user.

**Notes**

- lots of stuff buried in query. What information/interface is needed for
  resolution/expansion of the query? For example a particular user may be
  identified with a particular community which uses a particular ontology.
  Where are things like ontologies maintained and where are the interfaces
  between these and searches maintained? Searches need to be able to respond
  to the dynamic nature of domain ontologies. Does the ontology need to have
  authorization tied to it? A use case would be an ontology which is under
  development and not ready for general distribution. Another case might be
  where the ontology contains representations of human subject information,
  meaning that "cancer survivors" includes this list of people. Or where the
  ontology provides geospatial information about restricted information
  (locations of USFS FIA plots). Similar issues apply to T&E species
  information.

- Group structure representation: A user is a member of zero to many groups,
  authorization may be carried with that group membership. This is down in the
  verify API, which needs to take into account group membership and group
  permission inheritance. Question: What is the resolution for conflicting
  access permissions?

- Q. Can a query be done at a member node? The diagram implies that the query is
  only done at a coordinating node. A member node may have a subset (or the
  full set) of metadata and the user may wish to do the search only at a
  member node, knowing that the subset is restricted to data relevant to a
  community of practice.

  A. First iteration will provide query service on CNs, though nothing to
  prevent MNs implementing query as well.

- Where is the filtering done for the results, in terms of when does the
  result set get filtered to those which the user can see? 

  Q. Does the model allow the query service to do two searches and union the
  results? The first query might be against the set of records known to be
  publicly readable, with a follow-on query against the set of records known
  to have restricted access. Is this envisioning the query service generating
  a set of results (against the restricted records) and passing that list to
  the authorization API, or is this envisioning a one by one situation. Or
  does the authorization API pass back to the query service the list of
  records that the user is authorized to see, and that gets anded with the
  result set.

  A. The resultset is a list of PIDs that needs to be vetted for read access.
  Hence query results can be merged (union) or joined as the output from such
  operations is always a list of PIDs that will be vetted for read access.

- How distributed is the database of users and their authorization records?
  
  Q. Does the coordinating node have to know all authorization records, with that
  being replicated? Or is some amount of the authorization maintained by (for
  example) the "owning" member node and the search system may need to contact
  multiple authorization authorities for the records in a particular result
  set? It also implies that if the authorization information is at the
  coordinating node, that the authorization authority needs a means to
  validate the replicated authorization information to ensure that the info at
  the cn is up-to-date.

  A. One scenario is that all authorization information is stored in the
  system metadata with each object. Then authorization can be performed by MNs
  or CNs.

- Q. Why does step 4 need to validate the token, given that the token was
  generated in step 2? 

  A. This is normal security validation of all user inputs once those have
  gone out of the control of the issuing service. Also applies to cases where
  tokens have a specific lifetime, and the token may be valid, but expired.
  Authorization token lifetimes are important for both interactive sessions
  and for cases like workflows, where the session may run for days.

- What logging level is required for the operation? Should the search appear
  as a hit against each object? Just log the query (and perhaps who did it)?
