Goal
  CN should support forward migration of metadata documents from one version
  to another within a standard and to other standards.

Summary 

  The standards to which science metadata are developed evolve over time, and
  it should be possible to perform lossless update of science metadata to
  ensure that content is kept up-to-date with current use standards.

  Since Coordinating Nodes hold original copies of all science metadata, it
  should be reasonably straight forward for a privileged service on a CN to
  create new versions of science metadata given appropriate tools for 
  performing the transforms. The original copies of the metadata should be
  preserved and the associated system metadata references updated to indicate
  the newer version of the science metadata.

  Note that while technically feasible, such a service may not be desirable as
  it implies a level of control exerted by the Coordinating Nodes that may be 
  in conflict with data sharing and participation agreements.

Actors
  - Coordinating Nodes
  - Science metadata
  - Data managers
  - Science metadata translation tools

Preconditions 
  - A new version of a science metadata standard exists
  - Content exists in the deprecated version
  - A translation tool exists for performing the migrations
  - Agreements for the update have been secured
  
Triggers
  - A new metadata standard revision is released
 
Post Conditions
  - Copies of metadata in the new version are created
  - References between the new and deprecated copies are created
  - Watchers of the objects are notified of the changes

**Notes**

- Should this apply to data as well?
