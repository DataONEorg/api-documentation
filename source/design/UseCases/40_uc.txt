Goal
  A Member Node requests synchronization by a Coordinating Node.

Summary 
  Member Node synchronization is typically driven by the Coordinating Node
  which polls Member Nodes on a regular basis and performing synchronization
  as necessary. Some situations may benefit from the Member Node requesting
  synchronization. For example:

  - A large amount, or perhaps high priority data was added to a MN and the
    owners or curators prefer to have the content synchronized as soon as
    possible rather than during the next scheduled time.

  - A MN may be going offline (e.g. unscheduled maintenance) and the
    administrator wants to ensure the synchronized content is up to date
    beforehand.

  Note there is some implication that MN replication will also be driven by
  this request (a process downstream from synchronization)

Actors
  - Member Node
  - Coordinating Node
  - Member Node administrator
  - Data curator
  - Data owner

Preconditions 
  - Member, Coordinating Nodes operational
  - Member node registered
  - New content exists on a Member Node
  
Triggers
  - Administrator requests synchronization
  - Curator or owner requests synchronization
  - Member Node logic determines that synchronization is necessary
 
Post Conditions
  - Member Node synchronization is scheduled
