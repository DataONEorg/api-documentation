Use Case 08 - Replication Policy Communication
----------------------------------------------

Author

Date
  - 20090925 Adding to use case description and documentation
  - 20090114 (TWG meeting).  Subsequent various modifications.

Version 
  Draft

Goal
  Communication of replication policy metadata between Member Nodes and
  Coordinating Nodes.

Summary 

  The replication policy of Member Nodes (MN) indicates factors such as the
  amount of storage space available, bandwidth constraints, the types of data
  and metadata that can be managed, and perhaps access control restrictions.
  This information is used by Coordinating Nodes (CN) to balance the
  distribution of data packages throughout the DataONE system to achieve the
  goals of data package persistence and accessibility.

Actors
  Member Node, Coordinating Node

Preconditions 
  - Member Node is registered with a Coordinating Node

  - Member Node is operational
  
  
Triggers
  - A Member Node changes available capacity, bandwidth or some other
    operating characteristic

  - A Member Node changes available services

  - A Member Node software stack is updated (e.g. new version)


Post Conditions
  - The DataONE system is updated with current state of available resources

  - Change in replication policy may trigger a re-synchronization (e.g. if
    storage capacity shrinks or is enlarged)

  - Operation is logged

  - Watchers are notified in change in DataONE system property  

  


**Notes**

- The goal as stated originally for this use case was "Communication of
  replication policy metadata among Member Nodes and Coordinating Nodes."

- There should be some restriction on how often replication policy can be
  changed to avoid thrashing that might occur for example, if a MN flips
  between significant differences in storage capacities (low to high, then low
  again).
