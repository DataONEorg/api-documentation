.. uml:: 

   actor "User (Data Owner)" as user
   participant "Client" as app_client << Application >>
   user -> app_client
   participant "Authentication API" as c_authenticate << Coordinating Node >>
   app_client -> c_authenticate: login (user, pw)
   app_client <-- c_authenticate: token or failure
   participant "Query API" as c_query << Coordinating Node >>
   app_client -> c_query: getAllCopies (token, ownerID)
   participant "Authorization API" as c_authorize << Coordinating Node >>
   c_query -> c_authorize: isAuth (token, resultset)
   participant "Verify API" as c_ver << Coordinating Node >>
   c_authorize -> c_ver: isValidToken (token)
   c_authorize <-- c_ver: T or F
   c_query <-- c_authorize: T or F
   app_client <-- c_query: records or fail
   participant "CRUD API" as c_crud << Coordinating Node >>
   app_client -> c_crud: deleteRecords (token, listOfGUIDs)
   app_client <-- c_crud: ack or fail
   note right
   Can the Query API find out where all
   copies of my data are in the system
   or should this be handled by another
   API?
   end note

*Figure 1.* Interactions for use case 23, User can find out where all copies
of my data are in the system and\ncan expunge them
