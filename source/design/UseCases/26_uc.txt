Goal
  System performs data quality checks on data.

Summary 

  This use case is similar to :doc:`Use Case 25<25_uc>` except extends further
  to evaluate additional attributes of data quality.

  Note - if the intent of this use case is to help ensure that quality data
  (sensu quality for research use) exists in the DataONE system, then it 
  may be more appropriate to evaluate the quality of content as it is
  being added to the system.

  The intent of this use case requires additional clarification.

data


**Notes**

- Is this more for verifying the quality of metadata? Otherwise how does it
  differ from :doc:`Use Case 25<25_uc>`?
