.. _UC20:

-------------------------------------------

.. index:: Use Case 20, UC20, aggregate, log, owner logs

Revisions

Goal
  Data owners can request aggregated CRUD log for {time period/pid} for
  all of 'their' objects.

Summary
  This operation provides a mechanism for data contributors to retrieve use
  information for content that they own. This is similar to :doc:`Use Case 19
  <19_uc>` except that the requesting use is authenticated, and a query on
  objects owned by the user is used to generate a list of PIDs that indicate
  log information to be retrieved.

Actors
  - Data owner

  - Coordinating Node

Preconditions
  - User has authenticated

  - Log statistics are available

Triggers
  - Authenticated user requests use information

Post Conditions
  - User has a copy of use information

   actor "User (Data Owner)" as user
   participant "Client" as app_client << Application >>
   user -> app_client
   participant "Authentication API" as c_authenticate << Coordinating Node >>
   app_client -> c_authenticate: login (user, pw)
   app_client <-- c_authenticate: token or failure
   participant "Query API" as c_query << Coordinating Node >>
   app_client -> c_query: getLogRecords (pid, fromDate, toDate)
   participant "Authorization API" as c_authorize << Coordinating Node >>
   c_query -> c_authorize: isAuth (token, resultset)
   participant "Verify API" as c_ver << Coordinating Node >>
   c_authorize -> c_ver: isValidToken (token)
   c_authorize <-- c_ver: T or F
   c_query <-- c_authorize: T or F
   app_client <-- c_query: records or fail
   note right
   Can the Query API handle queries
   on log records or should this be
   handled by another API?
   (e.g. "Report API"?)
   end note
