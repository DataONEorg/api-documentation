Goal
  User Authentication - Person via client software authenticates against
  Identify Provider to establish session token.

Summary 
  Many operations in the DataONE system require user authentication to ensure
  that the user's identity is known to the system, and that appropriate access
  controls can be executed based on the identity.

  The actual identity and authentication framework may exist outside of
  DataONE (one possible example might be the emerging `CILogon service`_).

  The authentication process might occur using either a Coordinating Node or a
  Member Node (if it implements the DataONE authentication API).
  
  See also some notes about discussion at :doc:`/Authentication`


Actors
  User, Member Node, Coordinating Node, Authentication System


Preconditions 
  - User is not authenticated in the system


Triggers
  - A user logs on to the DataONE system.

  - A user tries to perform an operation in the DataONE system that requires
    authentication.

 
Post Conditions
  - An ``auth_token`` is returned to the user (application) that can be used
    for future interactions with the DataONE system.

  - In the event of authentication failure, the ``auth_token`` will provide
    identity equivalent to an anonymous user.

  - The authentication operation is recorded in MN or CN logs (depending on
    where the authentication attempt was made)


**Notes**

- To be a bit more abstract, it might be good to use something like
  login(user, credentials) or login(subject) for the method signature. Here
  "subject" would be similar to the `javax.security.auth.Subject
  <http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html>`_
  concept. (PEA)

- Can logins also happening against a MN, which simply proxies the request up
  to the CN? (PEA)

- Need to specify a time to live for auth_tokens. Is this part of the
  authentication sub-system? If so, can the TTL be altered by the DataONE
  system?

      The authentication system may be an external
      service or could be operating on the CN.
