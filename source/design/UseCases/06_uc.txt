Date
  - 20091127 [PEA] Made consistent with V0.3 APIs.
  - 20090930 Filled out content, changed mode to pull from MN
  - 20090925 Adding to use case description and documentation
  - 20090114 (TWG meeting).  Subsequent various modifications.

Goal

  Science metadata records present in a Member Node are synchronized to a
  Coordinating Node.

Summary

  As content is added to Member Nodes, the associated system metadata and
  science metadata documents are copied to a Coordinating Node. Once the
  objects are registered with the Coordinating Node they are available for
  transfer to other Coordinating and Member nodes.

Actors

  Member Node, Coordinating Node

Preconditions 

  - CN and MN operational
  - New content available on a Member Node

Triggers

  - Periodic polling of MNs
  - Signal to CN issued by a MN that is requesting synchronization

Post Conditions

  - All system and science metadata records from a MN are also present on the
    CN

*Figure 2.* Sequence diagram for use case 06. Synchronize metadata between
Member and Coordinating Node. Note that the log messages record a REPLICATE
rather than a READ event. The MN determines this through the User Agent header
(NB - this assumes that CNs only call MN.get to do replication).


Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Member Node synchronization process will operate in an asynchronous
manner, with a task queue on the CN service containing a list of objects that
need to be added to the coordinating node populated through two mechanisms: 

1. scheduled calls to :func:`MN_crud.listObjects` 

2. through a new notification API that is called by a Member Node after a
   successful create operation.

The task queue is processed by a pool of workers which retrieve the content
using :func:`MN_crud.get` and :func:`MN_crud.getSystemMetadata`, and store the
content in the Coordinating Node using the internal :func:`CN_crud.create`
method.

The initial implementation will focus on using only scheduled calls to
:func:`MN_crud.listObjects` to populate the task queue. The scheduling
information shall be set during the MN registration process.

Multiple threads should be able to process the task queue, and the number of
threads should be adjustable by an administrator. The total number of threads
hitting on a particular MN should be limited, the limit should be specified in
the MN capabilities recorded during the registration process.

The tasks queue will need to be thread safe. In the future it may be feasible
to use a distributed queue (based on Apache MQ or Zookeeper for example;
shared across the CNs) so that processes on any CN can issue the
:func:`MN_get` and :func:`MN_getSystemMetadata` requests.

There will likely be a significant load on the system for indexing as new
content is being added - this is the case for both Mercury and Metacat.
Options for disabling indexing for bulk load should be considered.


The synchronization process will certainly be more sophisticated down the road,
but for now (i.e. prototype implementation) simplicity should be a priority:

- MNs are only scanned by the CN where they are registered (restriction to be
  dropped down the road).

- listObjects is polled (with max objects set to some limit), with results
  stored in a queue on the CN

- as the queue is processed and shrinks to some size, then listObjects process
  is polled again

- the queue is processed by n worker threads, with each task being to pop an
  entry from the queue, pull the content from the target, and store it in the
  object store.

- when there is some number of new entries in the object store, then the
  mercury indexing process needs to kick in. Ideally this should be updating
  rather than re-creating the index at each pass. This may be initiated by a
  cron job for the prototype implementation.

This fairly simplistic approach should be enough to get things started. Not
ideal, but should suffice to get some data moving around. To implement, there
is need for a few new components - a queue, a place to store state
information, the code that does the polling, the code that does the object
retrieval, the worker thread code, and an overall controller service.


In more detail
..............

Retrieve objects from Member Nodes. getNextMemberNode() gets the next Member
Node to work on - this could be serial selection from the list of registered
MNs, could be based on the last update, perhaps from some hint returned in
:func:`MN_health.ping`.

New structures::

  MemberNodeState
    String url;  //URL of the member node
    DateTime lastCheckTime;  // time stamp for when the MN was last polled for listOjects


  RetrievalTask
    String url;
    ObjectInfo objectInfo;



Populating the harvest task queue pseudo code::

  void populateTaskQueue ()
  {
    ThreadSafeQueue taskQueue = getSharedTaskQueue()
    while ( keepRunning() )
    {
      if (taskQueue.length < MIN_TASKS)
      {
        MemberNodeState = getNextMemberNode();
        
        // This could be executed in a different thread, which would
        // enable multiple MNs to be polled at a tme if necessary
        int numNewEntries = loadMNTasks(taskQueue, mnState);
      }
    }
  }


Processing the harvest task queue pseudo code::

  int loadMNTasks(ThreadSafeQueue taskQueue, MemberNodeState mnState)
  {
    AuthToken token = getSystemToken();
    D1cient client = D1Client( mnState.url );

    // get a list of all the new entries since lastCheckTime
    DateTime tstamp = now();

    // Will actually need to loop here to page through results
    ObjectList objectList = client.listObjects(token, mnState.lastCheckTime);
    for (ObjectInfo objinfo : objectList)
    {
      RetrievalTask task = RetrievalTask(mnState.url, objinfo)
      taskQueue.push(task)
    }
    mnState.lastCheckTime = tstamp;
    setMemberNodeState(mnState);
    return objectList.length;
  }


Worker threads are responsible for retrieving each object listed in the
taskQueue. The number of workers should be adjustable. An obvious target for
improving efficiency is to enable requesting multiple objects in a single call
to a MN (later enhancement)::

  // object is the next entry from the taskQueue
  bool retrieveObject(String mnurl, ObjectInfo object)
  {
    Authtoken token = getSystemToken();
    D1Client client = D1Client(mnurl);
    SystemMetadata sysmeta = client.getSystemMetadata( object.identifier );
    if ( isScienceMetadata(sysmeta.objectClass) )
    {
      scimeta = client.get( object.identifier );
      CN_SERVICE.create( object.identifier, sysmeta, scimeta );
    }
    else
    {
      CN_SERVICE.create( object.identifier, sysmeta );
    }
  }
