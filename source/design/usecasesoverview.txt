Overview
========

An important early part in the process of system architecture is identifying the
functional requirements that the resulting system should be able to address. Use
cases are helpful for this as they describe how actors (typically entities
external to the system) interact with system components. Interaction diagrams
help define the interfaces and messages transmitted between components.


Use Case Layout
---------------

Each use case document is structured following a common template which
includes the following elements.

  Author
   Who generated the use case. This will usually be "VDC TWG" or "DataONE".

  Date
   Date the use case was identified and known subsequent modifications.

  Version
   One of "Draft", "Review", "Published"

  Goal
   Brief description of what is intended with the use case.

  Summary
   An overview of the use case which includes the goal and major actors.

  Use case diagram
   A diagram representation of the use case, somewhat following the UML.

  Sequence diagram
   A sequence diagram that shows the operations involved in addressing the use
   case. 

  Actors
   The participants in the use case - includes people and systems.

  Preconditions
   The conditions that must exist for the use case. For example, a particular
   use case may only be valid if the use has been authenticated.

  Triggers
   Describes the even that causes the use case to be initiated.
 
  Postconditions
   The state of the system after the use case - what conditions are true after
   the use case is completed.

  Notes 
    Miscellaneous notes and discussion items that can't be placed in the
    various categories. Comments should be annotated with time and author.
