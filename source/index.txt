DataONE Architecture
====================

The Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE_) is an `NSF funded project`_
in the DataNet program charged with implementing and deploying core services
and infrastructure to improve the long term accessibility and re-use of data
collected through NSF funded and other research projects.

These documents provide the reference for implementation of services and tools
that together form the DataONE cyberinfrastructure.
