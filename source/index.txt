DataONE Architecture
====================

The Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE_) implements and deploys
core services and infrastructure to support long term access and re-use of
data collected through NSF funded and other research projects.

These documents provide the architecture and API reference for deployed
DataONE cyberinfrastructure.


API Reference
-------------

The Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for DataONE are described here.
APIs are exposed by the DataONE Coordinating Nodes (Coordinating Node APIs)
and data repositories participating as Member Nodes (Member Node APIs).

All API interactions occur over HTTPS with XML encoded messaged and a RESTful
approach.
