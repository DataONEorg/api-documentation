DataONE Architecture
====================

The Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE_) implements and deploys
core services and infrastructure to support long term access and re-use of
data collected through NSF funded and other research projects.

These documents describe the architecture and APIs for deployed
DataONE cyberinfrastructure.


API Reference
-------------

Components of the DataONE infrastructure interact through the DataONE APIs.
Participating data repositories expose the :doc:`apis/MN_APIs` and Coordinating Nodes
expose the :doc:`apis/CN_APIs`.

API service endpoints use a restful pattern. All API interactions occur over HTTPS with
XML encoded messages. The XML messages are defined by the :doc:`DataONE Types XML Schema<apis/Types>`.
:doc:`apis/Exceptions` are cast to applicable HTTP error codes, with the response body
containing an XML representation of the error. The RESTful implementation is more fully
described in the :doc:`apis/rest_comms`.

Design Documents
----------------

The design documents describe the intended functionality of the DataONE infrastructure. :doc:`design/userscenarios` provide a functional overview from a user perspective. :doc:`design/usecases` provides a more detailed view of how the APIs are used to support specific component interactions.
