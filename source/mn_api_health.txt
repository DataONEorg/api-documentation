  getOperationStatistics(token) -> operationStatistics


.. function:: ping() -> PingResponse

  .. note::
    This method will be used by Use Case 10 "MN Status Reports" for V0.3. For
    later API versions, getStatus() will be used.

  Low level "are you alive" operation. Response is simple ACK, but may be
  reasonable to overload with a couple of flags that could indicate
  availability of new data or change in capabilities.
 
  The Member Node should perform some minimal internal functionality testing
  before answering. However, ping checks will be frequent (every few minutes) so
  the internal functionality test should not be high impact.

  :returns: A PingResponse that indicates if the MN considers itself fully
  functional and includes a timestamp for when the response was produced.
  
  :rtype: class:`Types.PingResponse`


.. function:: getStatus() -> StatusResponse

  .. note::
    This method will be used by Use Case 10 "MN Status Reports" for API versions
    after V0.3. For previous versions, ping() will be used.

  This function is similar to ping() but returns a more complete status which
  may include information such as planned service outtages.
  
  :returns: A StatusResponse.
  
  :rtype: class:`Types.StatusResponse`


.. function:: getObjectStatistics(token) -> objectStatistics

  Returns statistics about the object collection on the MN.
  
  :param time: Limit to date range. See Wildcards and Range Operators.
  
  :param format: Limit to objects of given format.
  
  :param day:
    Flag that causes a separate set of statistics to be returned for each day.
    Without this flag, a single, cumulative set of statistics is returned.
  
  :param token: Identity with authority to retrieve the statistics.

  :rtype: :class:`Types.objectStatistics`


.. function:: getOperationStatistics(token) -> operationStatistics

  Returns statistics about the operations, such as object creation and access,
  that have been performed on the MN.
  
  :param time: Limit to date range. See Wildcards and Range Operators.
  
  :param requestorIdentitity: Limit to operations performed by given requestor.
  
  :param day:
    Flag that causes a separate set of statistics to be returned for each day.
    Without this flag, a single, cumulative set of statistics is returned.
    
  :param token: Identity with authority to retrieve the statistics.
  
  :returns: A status document in an easily parsed syntax such as JSON or XML
  
  :rtype: :class:`Types.OperationStatistics`
