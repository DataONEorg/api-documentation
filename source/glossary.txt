  API
    Application Programming Interface. Software interacts with libraries,
    applications, and systems through APIs they expose. See also :doc:`apis/index`.

  authentication
    Authentication is the process of verifying a claim made by a subject that
    it should be allowed to act on behalf of a given principal (person,
    computer, process, etc.). Authentication in DataONE is described in
    :doc:`design/UseCases/12_uc`.

  authorization
    The process of verifying that a subject has permission to access specific
    resources or perform specific actions. Authorization in DataONE is
    described in :doc:`design/UseCases/13_uc`.

  cicore
    Refers to the essential, core components of the DataONE
    cyberinfrastructure. This includes the :term:`Member Node`\s,
    :term:`Coordinating Node`\s, and the :term:`Investigator Toolkit`
    libraries.

  Coordinating Node
    See :term:`Coordinating Node`

  Coordinating Node
    One of at least three nodes in the DataONE cyberinfrastructure that is
    responsible for maintaining a complete collection of all :term:`science
    metadata`, all :term:`system metadata`, a record of the location of all
    objects stored in the :term:`DataONE` system, and provides mechanisms for
    search and retrieval of all content. Coordinating Nodes store all original
    copies of :term:`science metadata`. All Coordinating Node content is
    replicated between other Coordinating Nodes. Coordinating Nodes drive
    the replication of content between Member Nodes.

  Coordinating Node Replication
    In DataONE, refers to the process by which content that appears on any one
    Coordinating Node is mirrored to all other Coordinating Nodes. See also
    :term:`Member Node synchronization` and :term:`data replication`.

  data
    See :term:`data`.

  Data
    Typically refers to :term:`science data`. Where ambiguity between the
    science data and another form of data, the full term "science data" should
    be used. 

  data package
    A data package is a set of one or more :term:`data` objects, :term:`science metadata` 
    objects, and :term:`system metadata` documents that together represent a scientifically 
    useful unit of information.

  data replication
    The transfer of content between Member Nodes as directed by the
    Coordinating Nodes.

  DataONE
    An NSF sponsored project implementing cyberinfrastructure according to
    guidelines indicated in the NSF `DataNet RFP`_.

  detail code
    Part of an exception that represents an error condition in the DataONE
    APIs. The error detail code is specific to an API method. See also
    :mod:`Exceptions`.

  PID
    Persistent Unique Identifier. A string of printable Unicode characters
    that uniquely identifies an object within the DataONE infrastructure. See
    :class:`Types.Identifier`

  identifier
    A synonym for :term:`PID`.

  identity 
    Refers to the properties of a user or :term:`principal` that enables the
    DataONE system to distinguish them from other users.

  Investigator Toolkit
    Software libraries, applications, and other tools that enable interaction
    with the DataONE system, typically by enabling storage of content on a
    Member Node and/or by enabling search and retrieval of content from the
    DataONE infrastructure.

  Member Node
    See :term:`Member Node`.

  Member Node
    A data holding node that implements all or the essential elements of the
    member mode :term:`API`\s (see :doc:`apis/MN_APIs`). Member Nodes accept
    content from users and may store content replicated from other member
    nodes as directed by a Coordinating Node.

  Member Node synchronization
    The process of updating a :term:`Coordinating Node` with the science and
    system metadata that appears on a :term:`Member Node`.

  metadata
    Data describing data. There are currently two distinct forms of metadata
    managed by DataONE, :term:`science metadata` and :term:`system metadata`.

  node event log
    The node event log is implemented on Coordinating Nodes and Member Nodes
    and should record all object access and manipulation events.

  principal
    A user that is a recognized :term:`identity` in the DataONE system

  replication
    See :term:`Coordinating Node replication` or :term:`data replication`.

  session
    In the context of DataONE, a session refers to the operations that occur
    with a single authentication token.

  science data
    Science data that is stored in the DataONE system. See :doc:`design/WhatIsData`
    for a description of what is considered data in DataONE. DataONE services
    always return exact copies of the original data as submitted to DataONE.

  science metadata
    Metadata that describes the data that is replicated across the Member Nodes.

  sysmeta
    See :term:`system metadata`

  system metadata
    Metadata that is used internally by the DataONE system to record system
    properties about each object stored in the DataONE system. See
    :class:`Types.SystemMetadata` and :mod:`SystemMetadata`. Also referred to as
    :term:`sysmeta`\.

  token
    In DataONE, refers to the package of information returned from a
    :func:`CN_authentication.login` operation that can be subsequently trusted
    to accurately and unambiguously identify a :term:`principal`.
