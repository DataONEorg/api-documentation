   API

     Application Programming Interface. Software interacts with libraries,
     applications, and systems through APIs they expose. See also :doc:`apis/index`.

   authentication

     Authentication is the process of verifying a claim made by a subject that
     it should be allowed to act on behalf of a given principal (person,
     computer, process, etc.). Authentication in DataONE is described in
     :doc:`design/UseCases/12_uc`.
  
   authorization

     The process of verifying that a subject has permission to access specific
     resources or perform specific actions. Authorization in DataONE is
     described in :doc:`design/UseCases/13_uc`.

   Authoritative Member Node

     Recorded in :term:`SystemMetadata` for an object, the Authoritative
     Member Node has all the rights of the :term:`rightsHolder` to maintain
     and curate the object, including making any changes necessary.

   checksum

     A string representing the computed hash of an object using an algorithm
     supported by the DataONE infrastructure (MD5 or SHA-1). Checksums are
     used to assist with the bit-level preservation of content.

   cicore
   CICore

     Refers to the essential, core components of the DataONE
     cyberinfrastructure. This includes the :term:`Member Node`\s,
     :term:`Coordinating Node`\s, and the :term:`Investigator Toolkit`
     components.

   CN
   Coordinating Node

     One of at least three nodes in the DataONE cyberinfrastructure that is
     responsible for maintaining a complete collection of all :term:`science
     metadata`, all :term:`system metadata`, a record of the location of all
     objects stored in the :term:`DataONE` system, and provides mechanisms for
     search and retrieval of all content. Coordinating Nodes store all original
     copies of :term:`science metadata`. All Coordinating Node content is
     replicated between other Coordinating Nodes. Coordinating Nodes drive
     the replication of content between Member Nodes.

   Coordinating Node Replication

     Refers to the process by which content that appears on any one Coordinating
     Node is mirrored to all other Coordinating Nodes. See also :term:`Member
     Node synchronization` and :term:`data replication`.

   data
   Data

     Typically refers to :term:`science data`. Where ambiguity between the
     science data and another form of data may be interpreted or implied, the
     full term "science data" should be used.

   data package

     A data package is a set of one or more :term:`data` objects and
     :term:`science metadata` objects that together represent a scientifically
     useful unit of information. Data packages are defined in DataONE using
     :term:`resource maps`.

   data replication

     The transfer of content between Member Nodes as directed by the
     Coordinating Nodes. Also referred to as just "replication".

   DataONE

     An NSF sponsored project implementing cyberinfrastructure according to
     guidelines indicated in the NSF `DataNet RFP`_.

   detail code

     Part of an exception that represents an error condition in the DataONE
     APIs. The error detail code is specific to an API method and is intended
     to be only useful to the implementors of the service that generates an
     exception to help identify the location in the code where the exception
     originated. See also :mod:`Exceptions`.

   Group
   group

     Group represents metadata about a :term:`Subject` that represents a
     collection of other Subjects. Groups provide a convenient mechanism to
     express access rules for certain roles that are not necessarily tied to
     particular :term:`principals` over time.

   identifier
   pid
   PID

     Persistent Unique Identifier. A string of printable Unicode characters that
     uniquely identifies an object within the DataONE infrastructure. See
     :class:`Types.Identifier`

   identity 

     Refers to the properties of a user or :term:`principal` that enables the
     DataONE system to distinguish them from other users.

   ITK
   Investigator Toolkit

     Software libraries, applications, and other tools that enable interaction
     with the DataONE system, typically by enabling storage of content on a
     Member Node and/or by enabling search and retrieval of content from the
     DataONE infrastructure.

   MN
   Member Node

     A data holding node that implements all or the essential elements of the
     member mode :term:`API`\s (see :doc:`apis/MN_APIs`). Member Nodes accept
     content from users and may store content replicated from other member nodes
     as directed by a Coordinating Node.

   metadata

     Data describing data. There are currently two distinct forms of metadata
     managed by DataONE, :term:`science metadata` and :term:`system metadata`.

   node event log

     The node event log is implemented on Coordinating Nodes and Member Nodes
     and should record all object access and manipulation events.

   Registry
   node registry
   Node Registry

     A list of nodes participating in DataONE maintained by Coordinating
     Nodes. Entries in node registry may be retrieved through the
     :func:`CNCore.listNodes` method of a Coordinating Node.

   Origin Member Node 

     The :term:`Member Node` where an object was first registered with the
     DataONE infrastructure.

   Public
   public user
   Public User

     The default user identity used when a service is called without supplying
     user credentials. The public user SHOULD never have write access to any
     services and MAY be limited access to some services in addition to the
     usual restrictions imposed by access control. The public user
     :term:`subject` can be any of "Public", "AuthenticatedUser",
     "VerifiedUser".

   principal
   principals

     A principal refers to the entity (e.g. a person) that is assigned one or
     more :term:`subjects`.

   replication

     See :term:`Coordinating Node replication` or :term:`data replication`.

   replication target

     A Member Node that can be directed by a Coordinating Node to retrieve
     content from another Member node to support the process of
     :term:`replication`.

   resource map
   resource maps

     TODO

   rightsHolder
   Rights Holder

     The :term:`Subject` that has full control over the access control rules
     for an object.

   session

     In the context of DataONE, a session refers to the operations that occur
     with a single authentication token.

   data
   science data

     Science data that is stored in the DataONE system. See
     :doc:`design/WhatIsData` for a description of what is considered data in
     DataONE. DataONE services always return exact copies of the original data
     as submitted to DataONE.

   science metadata

     Metadata that describes the data that is replicated across the Member
     Nodes.

   subject
   subjects
   Subject

     Princpals (users) that are a recognized :term:`identity` in the DataONE system.

   synchronized
   synchronization
   Member Node synchronization

     The process of updating a :term:`Coordinating Node` with the science and
     system metadata that appears on a :term:`Member Node`. Also referred to
     as just "synchronization".

   sysmeta
   system metadata
   System Metadata
   SystemMetadata

     Metadata that is used internally by the DataONE system to record system
     properties about each object stored in the DataONE system. See
     :class:`Types.SystemMetadata` and :mod:`SystemMetadata`. Also referred to
     as :term:`sysmeta`\.

   token

     An X509 certificate generated by a trusted authority and is used to
     absolutely and unambiguously identify a :term:`principal`.

   verified

     A :term:`Subject` is verified in DataONE after going through a process to
     verify that the stated identity matches with an actual identity for the
     subject.

   whitespace

     Characters that produce no visible output other than influencing the
     spacing of other characters. For example the space character (ASCII 0x20)
     and the tab character (ASCII 0x09) are whitespace characters.

   DN
   Distinguished Name
   X.509 Distinguished Name
  
     TODO
     
     See also :term:`Subject`.
