Goal
  Coordinating Nodes publish metadata in formats for other discovery services
  like Google/Libraries/GCMD/etc.

Summary 

  This is a requirement, not a use case. DataONE needs to ensure that content
  is suitably exposed by appropriate, and standard mechanisms to ensure that
  non-DataONE indexing and search mechanisms can index and provide 
  discovery functionality for content available in the DataONE system. Note 
  that such indexing can not violate access control policies for the content, 
  and so indexing of all content should only occur with trusted services, and
  only public content should be accessible to services for which limited or
  no trust relationships have been established.
