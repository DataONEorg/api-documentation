Goal
  Create / update / delete / search workflow objects.

Summary 
  This use case describes the management of a workflow object within the
  DataONE infrastructure.

  *Note:* It is not clear why this should be treated any differently from the
  management of regular objects. A workflow could be treated like any other
  object within DataONE as far as object management, replication, preservation
  and discovery are concerned. Some additional features to support workflow
  staging and execution may emerge as separate use cases.


Actors

  - Client application

  - Member Node

  - Coordinating Node

Preconditions

  - User has authenticated with the DataONE system

Triggers
  - User adds, deletes, or modifies a workflow object

  - Metadata about workflow object is stored on Coordinating Nodes
