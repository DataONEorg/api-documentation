Use Case 07 - CN Batch Upload (Dupe of :doc:`UC06<06_uc>`)

Goal
  Batch Operations - Coordinating Node requests metadata /data list from new
  Member Node and then batch upload (disable indexing for example to improve
  insert performance).

Summary
  This is a dupe of Use Case 06 after refactoring that use case use a pull
  mechanism to retrieve changed records. The intent is to streamline the
  retrieval of large amounts of content from a MN, which perhaps involves
  turning of indexing and other potentially time consuming operations to speed
  the upload process.

Actors
  - Coordinating Node

  - Member Node

Preconditions
  - Large amount of metadata data is required to be uploaded to the CN

Triggers
  - Indication of a large amount of content to retrieves from a MN

Post Conditions
  - The upload is completed, CN synchronization is completed, MN replication
    is scheduled.
