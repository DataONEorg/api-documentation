Replication Notes
=================


:Author: Dave Vieglas


This document contains notes about replication that may be of some use in
DataONE.

General
-------

  1. Reduce complex transactions to be written by a single server

  2. Monitor the server log

  3. Be prepared for failure. The more data is distributed and scaled, the
     more likely failure will be encountered.

Coordinating Nodes
------------------

CNs need to keep a copy of all science metadata, and it is expected that
each CN will be replicated with the others, so that each will appear the same.

There will be three CNs to start with.

There's basically three models for dealing with replication in this case:

 - single master, two slaves
 - ring - write one, it writes to the next, and so on
 - multi-master. Write to any, replication to others

Multi-master replication would be the ideal option, as each CN would then
offer identical functionality rather than the alternative of redirecting
(presumably) 2/3 of requests to the master node.

There are basically two categories of information that are replicated:

  - science metadata, which is information about a data set

  - system metadata, which is information that is used to keep track of things
    such as the science metadata, MN capabilities and state, perhaps groups
    and access control lists, identity mappings

Member Nodes
------------

Replication of data is achieved by copying content between Member Nodes until
sufficient copies have been made to address concerns of access (x% of MNs may
be offline and the content can still be reached) and efficiency of access
(Internet distance between client and the MN).

Coordinating Node Object Store
------------------------------

The CN object store (CN-OS) is responsible for holding a copy of all science
and system metadata, enabling retrieval of objects by an identifier and for
ensuring that the local copy is synchronized with the other CNs. The CN-OS is
analogous to a replicated dictionary with the identifiers being keys and the
science or system metadata documents being the values.

The CN-OS should support operations:

- Create(pid)

- Read(pid)

- Update(pid)

- Delete(pid)

- List(start, stop, restriction)



Metacat As Replicating Object Manager
-------------------------------------

Metacat_ is a flexible metadata database that utilizes XML as a common syntax
for representing various types of metadata. In general, Metacat can be
considered functionally equivalent to an XML database.

Metacat supports replication of documents between instances, with replication
being triggered by several events:

- Timer, at pre-specified intervals
- Inserts, when a document is inserted locally
- Updates, when a document is updated locally
- Lock, when a lock is requested on a document (replication after lock received)

With Metacat filling the role of the Coordinating Node Object Store, each CN
Metacat instance would replicate with the other instances on the CNs. The
configuration for DataONE CNs would be something like:

===== ========== ========= ============= ====
host  server     replicate datareplicate hub
===== ========== ========= ============= ====
cn1   localhost  0         0             1
 .      cn2      1         0             1   
 .      cn3      1         0             1
cn2   localhost  0         0             1
 .      cn1      1         0             1   
 .      cn3      1         0             1
cn3   localhost  0         0             1
 .      cn1      1         0             1   
 .      cn2      1         0             1
===== ========== ========= ============= ====


Using a Distributed Lock Manager
--------------------------------

Apache Zookeeper_ can be used as a distributed lock manager to assist with
synchronization of records, especially across the CNs. Zookeeper is
interesting because it can potentially scale to many more than three CNs.

In this case we would create a globally synchronous lock on a specific PID
(essentially the same as the Lock operation of Metacat). The basic procedure
is described in the `Zookeeper recipes`_.


Distributed Execution Environment
---------------------------------

For example, hazelcast_. These types of solutions are typically developed with
LAN clusters in mind, and may run into problems with higher latency networks.
Interesting product though.


File Based Object Store with Distributed Revision Control
---------------------------------------------------------

These notes describe a strategy of utilizing the Linux file system and a
`distributed version control`_ system (DVC) such as Git_ or Mercurial_ as the
science and system metadata store for the Coordinating Nodes.

The basic approach is to treat all primary instances of science and system
metadata as files that are stored on the Linux file system. The files are
located in one or more folders that are under revision control using the DVC.
As a new metadata file is added to a CN, it is replicated to the other CNs on
a scheduled basis (e.g. every 10 minutes or when n files have been changed or
added). Change notification hooks (e.g. commit scripts) are used to update
local databases that are used to search science metadata (e.g. the Mercury
index) or the local system metadata database.


Scenario 1: Adding a new document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. A new document (d) is retrieved from a MN (or is pushed to the CN by the
   MN).

2. The document is added to the file system and added to version control. 

3. In response to some trigger (time or number of commits), the DVC initiates
   a sync with other repositories.


Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~

- Very simple replication mechanism
- Scalable, especially through partitioning of the file system
- No global write lock necessary
- Agnostic with respect to the file types
- Many existing tools
- Changes replicated through diffs
- Enable segmentation of all content through a simple taxonomy
- General approach is RCS agnostic - could use Git, Bazaar or any other
  distributed RCS system
- Change detection is trivial

Disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- File replication only, need to implement mechanisms for search etc
- No per-object access control
- Potential for collisions for object instances
- How to (automatically) resolve conflicts?
- Limitations on the absolute number of files per folder/filesystem
