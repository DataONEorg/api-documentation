**Response**

The response should be a valid HTTP response with a blank or arbitrary body.
Only the HTTP header information is considered by the requestor. A successful
response MUST have a HTTP status code of 200. In case of an error condition,
the appropriate HTTP status code MUST be set, and an exception or error
information MAY be returned in the response body.

**Example**

Example of ping request and response for a Member Node (Coordinating Nodes
implement the same functionality). Lines prefixed with ">" and "<" indicate
outgoing and returned information respectively. Lines associated with SSL
connection initiation and close are not shown here. Note that the actual response
headers may vary, the only required header fields are the first status line and a
``Date`` entry. However in order to fully support clients that may cache the response,
it is recommended that ``Expires``, and ``Cache-Control`` headers are returned.
